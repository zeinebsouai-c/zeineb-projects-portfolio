"1740377437","r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators","Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!","Anxiety"

"1750797868","It wasn’t cancer or anything scary, it was —- drumroll please—- SEASONAL ALLERGIES","My health anxiety has been THROUGH THE ROOF over the last month.  Started with some swollen lymph nodes in my neck, which freaked me out because I tragically lost my ESA to lymphoma last November, and just spiraled from there. So many random symptoms. Body aches, chest pain, chills with no fever etc etc. all scans and blood tests came back normal. Chest pain was getting worse. Shortness of breath.

Bruh.

I went to the doctor over the weekend because of some stuffiness in my ears, thinking maybe it was just a long lasting ear infection. 

The doc: “hey so are you aware you’re severely congested rn”

Me: “what”

The doc: “yeah you don’t have an ear infection you’re like super congested everywhere (tm).”

Me: “so like a virus or a cold or somethin???”

The doc: “nah, bro, it looks like allergies.”

Me: *surprised pikachu face because I have NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD ANY ALLERGIES (neither has any of my immediate family) which I proceed to tell him*

The doc: “yeah I mean I see it a lot, we have rly high pollen counts here so people develop allergies that never had them before. I can prescribe u an antihistamine if u want”

Me: “I mean I’ll try it???? Okay yeah sure???”

Me: *proceeds to take a benedryl and it is like a night and day difference and suddenly I can BREATHE*



SO YEAH

SEASONAL. FREAKIN. ALLERGIES.

Guys I was really out here writing last will and testament 😭😭😭 I hate anxiety so much

Anyways please use this as encouragement, it’s probably not something scary even if it feels that way !! I knew that logically but with trauma from losing my baby I wasn’t able to make it feel true, despite my best efforts. It is quite funny though because at some point during this I made some health anxiety affirmations for myself:


“Your body is good at its job.”

“Your body’s job is to keep you alive.”

“Your body is not trying to kill you.”


Which, yk, is now not ENTIRELY true considering allergies are the body just attacking itself cuz it decides it don’t like something in ur environment, so, by that logic, the body was trying to kill me a little bit, and was, in fact, a little bad at its job.","Anxiety"

"1750788748","Propranolol","Was prescribed propranalol (10mg pills) to combat my physical symptoms of my anxiety. (Heart palpitations, sweating, panic attacks). Took it for the first time today at 8 am, and was very scared to take it because of my health anxiety. Anyways a little later I noticed while working, I could barely feel my heart, which caused me not to think about palpitations, etc. did not feel my heart racing, and pounding when talking to customers, etc, and it was great. I may take a second dose when I get home later around 4. My doctor said to take 1-2 pills a day, 1 in am, and one in late afternoon/night. It’s been 6 hours and I may slightly feel it wearing off a bit, and I can start to feel my heart beat pretty good again, and it’s giving me a little anxiety. Also psa, I did an ekg at doctors and it came back fine. My blood test was good, and I’m going for a stress test at the end of the month! ","Anxiety"
"1750732370","I was robbed of my life. I hate that no one was ever concerned enough","11 years ago, when I was 16, I developed a panic disorder. I started having repeated panic attacks, and obviously like many others, my first instinct was to go to the ER with my mom a few times. 

Here's the thing, I live in a small town in Saudi Arabia. My mom is illiterate, and the doctor had told her that it was probably because I was watching porn. At the time, as a very direct result of my panic disorder, I was severely depressed. I was unable to move a muscle, and suicide ideation was, ironically, what kept me going. I could not bare to defend, or advocate for myself.

At that time, even though I was young, unwise, uneducated, and with so much prejudice against the taboo topic of psychiatric help, I knew what I had going on was not normal and needed medication. 

After few weeks of being completely sedentary, my mom approached me one day to ask if I wanted to visit a psychiatrist. My face lit up, and I said yes without missing a beat, but then she said: noo, people will say that you're crazy! 

I don't think any other single sentence was ever as traumatizing as this. Following this, I knew I was alone. I kept going with sheer will, and with the thought of offing myself always being in the back of my mind. 

I slowly got better, or so I thought. I still got panic attacks occasionally over the years but with a decreasing frequency. And over the years, I've become a lot more independent and had my own discretion, but I started having health anxiety. I was scared off medications because of the damn hysteria and misinformation and because of my cultural background. The knowledge that I was able to get through the worst of it without being medicated didn't help either. 

Little did I know, my undergraduate studies were interrupted a couple of times, and throughout the years I started repeatedly failing at different avenues of life. And funny enough, after being scared of seeking psychiatric help for so long, I later became an addict of every street drug there is. This got really bad at one point. 

Nevertheless, after all those years, I acknowledged that I needed help. After becoming hooked on so many drugs I was no longer scared of psychiatric medications, so I decided fuck it and reached out to a doctor. 

Now, six months later, I'm the biggest strong advocate of medications. I'm now the person I wish someone would have been for me. I'm not unapologetic about my recommendation. I'm not scared of liability or feelings of guilt; I strongly urge everyone who complains about their mental health to go see a psychiatrist. I wish someone was as adamant and confident when they advised me. ","Anxiety"

"1750765061","How do I accept the idea of death","Recently I’ve been really worried about death. The thought of not being able to do everything feel touch smell see is all really scary to me and I don’t know how to think about it. I try and think about what it would like to be dead but I physically can’t. I’m not religious. But the anxiety that I’m getting from this is making me not want to do anything in the case that I die while doing something, the thought of just not being here is really scary to me and I don’t know how to cope ","Anxiety"
"1750776931","I Thought I’d Never Heal","I’m 24, and to be honest, I’m still pretty raw. I’ve wrestled with OCD, anxiety rituals, and panic attacks that felt like they would never end. I’ve lost a lot along the way—parts of myself, relationships, stability. But I’m not drowning anymore. I’m starting to come back, slowly and unevenly, and weirdly enough, a few small things have helped me find my footing.

One of the first was something I call my “morning whisper.” When I wake up and manage to find even a sliver of quiet, I record a short voice note—just one line about how I’m feeling. Sometimes it’s “I’m scared of today,” other times it’s “I feel empty,” and once in a while it’s “I’m okay for now.” It doesn’t have to be poetic or profound. Just saying it out loud makes it feel less like a monster lurking in the corners of my mind.

Then there’s sunlight. Just five minutes of it. I step out onto my balcony, close my eyes, and let the sun hit my face. It’s such a small thing, but somehow it feels like a reset button for my nervous system. It reminds me that the world isn’t made entirely of shadows.

My therapist once suggested I try the Haven self-care app between sessions, and it’s become a lifeline. When anxiety spikes or I can’t sleep, I open the app and pour my thoughts into its little recorder. It listens and then gives me back a snapshot—a quick breakdown of my emotions. Seeing my thoughts reflected like that helps me make sense of what’s happening, especially when I’m not sitting across from her in that safe office space.

And maybe the strangest but most powerful ritual I’ve picked up is making private video confessions. I record myself talking to the camera—nothing polished, no audience. Just the raw truth. I say the things I’ve never said out loud before: “I’m scared I’ll never be okay,” “I miss who I used to be,” “I’m trying.” Somehow, giving those thoughts a voice, even if it’s only for me, makes them feel real and heard and maybe even a little less heavy.

I’m not “fixed.” Some days still suck. But these tiny rituals have given me something to hold onto—a sense that I’m moving forward, even if it’s one shaky, uncertain step at a time. If you’ve ever felt like you’re sinking, maybe try swapping one doom-scroll for one of these. You might be surprised at how much it helps. 💛","Anxiety"

"1750785960","It gets better","Hey everyone. Hello also people from Google. 

A few years ago I was like a lot of folks who had never had a panic attack and never suffered from anxiety. Now I suffer from periodic attacks, and a baseline noticeable level of anxiety. 

Long story short, I had my first panic attack a few years ago. I thought I was having a stroke or a heart attack and went to the ER. Obviously they told me it was just a panic attack, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t scary. It left me with PTSD - I never wanted to feel that ever again. 

I quit smoking weed and nicotine. I couldn’t drink alcohol or coffee for months. Any sort of out of mind, or mind altering, made me panic. 

I didn’t want to let it control me. I debated “sewer slide”. I thought about anything I could do to make it go away. 

I’m very lucky in that I have a wife who suffers from anxiety as well, and a mom that suffers from depression. They all talked me through all of it. This made me not feel alone. They talked me into getting a therapist. 

I’m here to tell anyone who needs to hear it that it gets better. It takes time but it does. I remember searching endlessly for proof tat it goes away. I feel like those who start to recover come to these communities less, but everyone could use some assurance. 

The volume of anxiety goes down. I was a 15/10. Now I’m a 3-4/10. I can drink coffee and a beer. I can go on a plane. I can socialize. I can do all the things I used to. 

Talk to someone. Get a therapist. It gets better. 

Much love ❤️","Anxiety"

"1750785026","Idk what’s wrong with me","The past few weeks or month or so I’ll go through these little spells of nausea and I used to never really get nauseous like that when I was experiencing anxiety but now more than ever when im anxious or even when I’m not particularly anxious in that moment I’ll get this slight feeling of nausea and then I’ll make myself more anxious about the nausea in hopes I don’t throw up especially if I’m in public which oddly makes me more nauseous it seems like. With that I’ll also get dizzy and it’s like I just have to sit there and hope it passes with deep breathing. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I’m more sensitive to heat now, which is new because I used to be able to tolerate the extreme heat but it never made me nauseous like it does now and the heat makes it all worse. Even when I’m not particularly in a hot area like in indoors I’ll get these like heat flashes. I’m just really confused about where this all stems from, and it’s a good chance it’s all from anxiety because I’ve been going through a lot of changes in my personal life and my anxiety’s been the highest it’s been in a long time. So that’s a good chance I’m just really considering going to the doctors and seeing if they can put me on anti nausea meds because it’s coming to the point of me not wanting to even go out of the house in fear I’ll get sick in public. I think I also trip myself out over it When I’m in public worried I’ll throw up because my mind will like worry itself out making me more sick.

Especially of the unpredictability of it's actions/invading my comfort zone","I have a huge phobia of insects, mice etc but especially when I didn't expect to see one/when they're in my safe zone. So when I see a spider out in the forest and it crawls on me? I see a mouse outside on the street? I don't care I go on it's fine.

 But seeing a tick on my dog? Having insects fly into my house when I have open window? Randomly seeing a stink bug in my room? A praying mantis on my bike as I'm riding it? I FREAK OUT. 

And usually it's not the insect itself. Yes there's insects I'm more scared of then others but usually it's the unpredictability of what's it going to do next. I know there's an insect but it disappears of my sight? I freak out because I don't know where it is and where it will appear again. I know the spider isn't venomous, I know the ladybug won't do anything to me but the sound of it flying around in my room is enough to give me goosebumps. 

I saw a stag beetle out in the open last week and even took a video of it because it was beautiful. But this? I will stay awake and it occupies my head for a long time.

So anyone with a similar problem? How did you get over this? I would like to somehow desensitize to it at least a little.  ","Anxiety"
"1750782423","Help my Nan deal with her feelings","Hi All, 

So my Nan is 90 years old, she is constantly in fear/scared about death and I'm looking for a way to help her be atleast a bit more at ease. 

Last year she had pneumonia and recovered just fine after a few months albeit with trouble breathing compared to before (which is expected at that age). She was generally happy about the situation and the fact that she was going back to as she was before. However, 1 month ago she had a chest infection and has anti biotics to help this, so hopefully that clears up soon as the doctor says. 

Every single day, she sits at home/at ours with nothing to do really. So she ends up focusing on the fact that her breathing isn't great, which makes her breathing hard, throat tight etc. Which then causes her to think worse about the situation. Not only that, when it gets to 7pm she is already trying to calm herself down as she hates evening/night time as she can't sleep and ends up focusing on her issues again/ causing herself to choke or get a heart attack. It's a self fulfilling prophecy really. 

So while I'm not asking for a way to fix her physical issues, realistically they won't heal to 100%. However, I'm after methods/techniques that she can employ to help her get used to her feelings and not dwell on them. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.","Anxiety"
"1750800305","Given buspirone as a take as needed anxiety relief Med","So after years of being depressed and my anxiety becoming unbearable where I'm missing work and falling behind on things, I finally caved and went to see someone about medication. My panic attacks have gotten so bad I'll pace the house for hours and will have to leave work early because of them. I had anxiety issues years ago without the depression and was on 1mg lorazepam 2 or 3x times a day(can't remember since it was so long ago) and I barely filled it and never abused it. Hell I never even took more than one a day and had this prescription for years. I'm talking about a prescription of 90 of them and I filled it like once every year and a half. I only stopped filling it because I got to a point in my life where I didn't feel I needed it. 

So I went in expecting to get an antidepressant(prozac), which I honestly wanted to try. No big deal. So then I'm given basically the option of a drowsy medicine(hydroxyzine), which I can't take since I run machines, and I'm given a non drowsy one(buspirone) as a take as needed. Obviously I take the non drowsy option but kind of upset lorazepam wasn't offered because even they made the comment that in my records it says I barely filled it but still gave me the whole habit forming and better alternative now spiel. But whatever, I accept the buspirone. Bottle says 5mg 2x as needed. 

So I get home and research both medications as I always do before putting something in my system to find out this buspirone is supposed to be used more like antidepressants and slowly builds up in your system. Is that right? If so, how do I approach them and tell them this is wrong. You also might have guessed this was a nurse practitioner as well. I was having a hard time finding places that accepted new patients(haven't been to a doctor in years), and this was kind of my last option. I kind of feel defeated because it took a lot out of me to even go in and accept help for this and was feeling pretty good after the visit.","Anxiety"

I have a severe chronic dissociative disorder for almost a decade, which I'm sure is the nail in the coffin for my nervous system and how it alters subconcious breathing, as it literally changes the body / preperation for death etc, shallow breathing, high alert and what not.

The last few years, I’ve had increasing palpitations and heart issues. I got a Holter monitor last year and it looked pretty good. Did it again last month and it was a lot worse- PVC/PACs had gone up 4x, multiple short term arrhythmias (including SVT lasting 8 beats and 5 others that they said not to worry about). 

Cardiologist and electrophysiologist both say that although the monitor shows my heart issues are worse, they aren’t concerned. But I am having a hard time trusting them and having bad panic attacks worrying I’m going to have a heart attack (which then leads to HR going up and more palpitations). I’ve been to the ER twice recently.

I’m 45 and going through perimenopause at the same time as all of this starting up.

Last year I took a 2 hour train journey to a town for a day trip, totally happy and content and about half way through I got this intense feeling of panic, I felt like I had to get off the train (I did) and I was hot (took off my jacket and shirt on the train) and it was really fkn scary as I had never had that sensation before and ever since then I’ve had a real fear of trains. I go up to London every now and then and each time I’ve gone (maybe 4-5 times) I’ve had a small spurt of panic on the way there and it lasts about 2 minutes then I’m okay so not to bad. Today I went to London (I drove) but had to get on a train for about 4 minutes. I absolutely freaked, my boyfriend had to almost push me back down into my seat, about 5 minutes into the journey I was okay. We got off and I thought I’d be fine as I’d never had this panic feeling in open environments (I’ve come to the conclusion it was closed spaces I knew I couldn’t get out of) but today I experienced it all fucking day on and off😢 We had to get a 30£ Uber back to the area we were in and cancel our dinner reservations as the idea of getting on the underground made me feel sick just thinking about it. When we got to our place I was okay ish and wasn’t really thinking about it, we decided to go to dinner at a place close to us and I was fine. Right before our meal came out the panic started again? So intensely too! I was absolutely freaked and I felt hot, nauseas and just like I had to get out of there. Absolute fight or flight like what I had felt in the other times during the day. We had to get our meal to takeaway. I was crying at the table not knowing what to do. What is this?! Ive looked into panic attacks and I don’t have the symptoms of dizziness or tingling but nor the symptoms of anxiety with shortness of breath. I assumed it was a trigger of enclosed spaces that I couldn’t get out of but today was all open areas and I’m just so upset! If anyone has any ideas please let me know :) thank you!!","Anxiety"

Last week I went to doctor and got a reading of 142/78 (which was taken by a nurse). I know it's pretty bad but I'd like to know if it was higher because of these:

- I was so stressed the whole time. I got to relax a bit before taking the blood pressure but I was so anxious about getting a high reading (before seeing the nurse I was crying)
- I didn't eat the whole day due to anxiety... I tend to feel sick if I eat when I'm nervous and the appointment was at 2pm.
- they did the blood pressure wrong. You are supposed to have your arm on top of a table right? The same level as your heart... Well, not only my arm was lowered but also slightly bent because I was in a chair
(The nurse didn't even know if my readings were correct 🤣🤣 she couldn't remember the normal values - that was so bad in my opinion)

Afterwards they sent me home, the stupid doctor didn't comment on anything. Didn't say a word to me about my high blood pressure.

I had a panic attack afterwards... Seeing my blood pressure so high.

Should I be concerned? I don't have much money to buy a monitor... Even if I did I felt like it would always display high numbers as Id get anxious before doing it.

"1750800900","This world is a horrific place and I no longer want to be apart of it.","Since the beginning of it all, humans have grown to be disgusting and cruel, all in the name of never-ending curiosity and a sickly sense of satisfaction towards the suffering of other people and animals.

I spent the few first years of my life in a fairly dangerous town. You couldn’t go a week or sometimes days without hearing that somebody had gotten shot, murdered, or rap*d. I was exposed to the world’s harsh realities at a very young age, and had to deal with my own families cruelty. 

I can’t recall how many times I have been called names, how many times i’ve been beaten by my own father, how many times i’ve been ripped from my own innocence and have gotten rap*d. The older I got, the more I was exposed to just how horrible people are.

Humans are capable of so much, and it’s terrifying. The news was just a harbor for all of its negativity and sorrow. School shootings, somebody being murdered or sexually assaulted, animal abuse, country genocide, wrongful deportations, the law, people who are supposed to protect us, failing us over and over again, siding with the people who are doing the hurting.

It’s like as each day goes by, the world gets worse. Human empathy and compassion is dead. Hate is so normalized and enabled. Why must we hate? Why must we destroy? Why must we hurt others? 

We all have the ability to love, to create, to make the world a place where everybody can be loved, accepted, and heard. And yet, we are going the opposite way. I will never understand it, I can’t wrap my mind around it.

I am 19 years old, and I am scared. I am so scared of this world, anything could happen to you, whether you’re outside in the world, or in the safe comforts of your home. I have endured so much hate and pain from the people who were supposed to love and protect me, from people who don’t even KNOW me.

I’ve always struggled with this compulsive fear of rejection. I’m completely terrified of other peoples’ opinions and terrified of being deemed a “bad” person by the standards of others. I attach my sense of self worth to the approval and validation of others. I feel like if I’m disliked in any way, then my life has zero value. If people don’t like me, then what is the point of existing? Because of this, I’m in a constant state of feeling like everyone hates me and that I don’t deserve to exist. I can’t even enjoy life. I feel like going outside in the sun and laughing is an insult to someone out there who is morally superior to me. These behaviors mostly into doomscrolling and validation seeking. 

Here is a lighthearted example before I get into the serious stuff: Let’s say there is a band I like. But a popular music critic and/or a friend doesnt like them. As a matter of fact they hate them. This critic gave the band a 1/10 and also called their fans idiots. My friend said the same thing. At this point, I’ll delete all their albums from Spotify, shove my shirts to the back of my closet, and never listen to them again. If I hear one of their songs in the radio, or see someone wearing their shirt in public, I’ll go into this dissociative state where I just repeat the critic or friends words in my head over and over and over again. I can’t ever enjoy the music again, because I don’t want to be an idiot like the critic said, I don’t want my friend to think I have bad taste. This is just how I act with something as silly as a music opinion. 

At the current moment, I feel guilty for being American. I feel like the whole world hates me. I’ve seen multiple posts on social media sayibg that all Americans are complicit, that America deserved 9/11, etc. 

Moreover, my dad is a veteran. I feel so much shame in this. I don’t know how many people he hurt over there. And then I go on social media and see that anti-veteran sentiment is becoming more and more popular. doomscrolling may be overexposing me, but it feels like everyday for the past few weeks I’ll see some “fck veterans” meme or post on Twitter or TikTok or even here on Reddit and it has 500,000 likes or something. I just keep seeing them pop up constantly. That signals to me, that there are 500,000 people out there who hate me by association. I. Feel. Awful. I feel like I don’t deserve to exist. Why was I born why do these people breed? I can’t take this anymore. I feel so hated and worthless. Please help me.

Hi.

So I have been diagnosed with a disease called Crohns Disease since december of last year, and the disease has not really given me any really bad symptoms. But a little over a month ago I started having panic attacks where my breathing gets laboured, cold sweats, etc. It is in a period where there is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to happen next as well. I am currently a pilot student and so far the disease has not really gotten in the way of my medical licence, but now I have been switched from a private GI to a GI connected to a hospital, and they are talking about starting me on a maintenance drug, they are talking about either Azathioprine or Adalimumab, but the panic attacks started before this, but has gotten worse / more frequent since this. It has gotten to a point where I struggle to leave the house because I fear that I might get a panic attack, and they primarily happen when I am not at home. I am curious to see if anyone else has expeirenced this or something similar? or if people have any advice besides seeing a therapist? My current plan is to wait until I actually start a maintenance drug, and to see if it calms down after that, and if not, I will visit a therapist. My current suspicion is that this is stress related due to all the uncertainty around my disease at the moment.

Back story - I’ve developed what I could consider pretty severe health anxiety in the last several months. It’s always been present but lately it has been significantly worse, basically worrying about a new thing every week, sometimes twice a week. 

The latest thing that’s happened has been a pretty constant feeling like I need to go pee, and more frequently going, it could be every 1-2 hours, but sometimes it’s only 20-30 minutes later that I’ll get a creeping sensation of it coming

Naturally I’m thinking about it a lot. Some basic bloodwork and urine sample has apparently come back normal. Naturally I’m worried why it’s still persisting now and if there is further physical investigation needed etc.

I’ve also found in the last few days I’ve had some middle back tightness 

this peeing thing has happened a handful of times over the last 9 months or so, and then it’s blown over a day or 2 later. And I haven’t thought about it as much. This time it’s been ongoing for about a week. I feel like im spiralling, but the urge to pee really is there.

I know this subject has been discussed before on here, but I’m looking for some updated thoughts or shared experiences if anyone can relate or has been through this. I’m freaked out about something that has yet to be discovered, and now if there’s any connection to the back tightness/pain. 

Any insight is really appreciated, especially on health anxiety and this peeing relationship. It feels too coincidental to me to not be anxiety, but I don’t know.

I was never able to go above 15mg because I couldn't stand the side effects. 
I still have anxiety. 
I would like to switch to clomipramine because I have been suffering from hyperacusis for a year and a half and it is the only antidepressant that can help with that.
My psychiatrist agrees but he wants to make the transition quickly in just 4 weeks. 
But I'm very afraid that I won't be able to tolerate paroxetine withdrawal and I don't know if clomipramine will be effective enough for severe anxiety and panic attacks.
Do any of you take clomipramine for anxiety and do you find it effective? 
Have some people already switched from paroxetine to clomipramine? ","Anxiety"

I recently underwent pharmacogenetic testing for psychiatry specifically, but however had medication unrelated for psychiatry. they were for autoimmune disorders. not necessarily meaning I have it, but it felt it started to explain so much and they targeted the symptoms I’ve been feeling. I thought maybe I should ask for further testing.

 I knew about my upcoming appointment with my pcp and knew I should ask. but my anxiety bested me. Cause last time my symptoms were written off as anxiety, I guess I worried I was going to be asking for too much. worried when I approached the topic of the testing, I was able to start but I guess I wanted it to end quickly. I was so so close, but stopped at the last second. I’m just trying to work through the white coat anxiety that I have. now I want to cry because I felt I let myself down, but my eyes are so dry I can’t even muster a single tear. Barely could feel my eyes water. I know the pain and the symptoms I feel are real, with or without a diagnosis. All I want is to keep learning to navigate this dynamic so I can better advocate for myself.

But that was different because I was prepared and I had rehearsed multiple times, I won't be able to do that in the oral exams) because my classmates are more eloquent and smarter than me.

I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't get accepted, my country (I'm in southern Europe) has little to no options, it's very hard, nearly impossible to get into an MA program outside of my country and this is the only MA program in my country that's in my field.

"1750792525","ANXIETY AND MEDICINES: Any idea what's going on?","First, I apologize for my English, but it's not my native language.

 

I'll try to be brief. About 12 years ago, I started experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety, such as dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, tunnel vision, tachycardia, chest palpitations, etc. A doctor prescribed me escitalopram, and after a few weeks, everything improved. During all those years, i was great, I tried other medications such as duloxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, fluvoxamine, etc. They all worked very well for me with no side effects except sexually, thats why I tried several options just to find the one that wouldn't cause them. I found that fluvoxamine worked perfectly.

 

The problem is that last year I tried to stop taking medications because i wanted to see if I no longer needed them. So I slowly tapered off the medicine. For about a month I was doing very well, but then the anxiety symptoms returned, dizziness, vertigo, rapid heart rate, and now depression too. So a psychiatrist prescribed me fluvoxamine again. This time it improved the vertigo and dizziness but caused a lot of fatigue and worsened other symptoms like rapid heart rate and confusion. We tried several options, such as escitalopram again, then desvenlafaxine, and with all of them some symptoms seem to improve and worsen others. The thing is that SSRIS (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or SNRIS (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) didn't cause any major problems before even when i used them for the first time years ago. I'm currently taking bupropion 150mg and gabapentin 300mg, and I'm better especially of the depression, but not completely about the anxiety, I still have some symptoms that aren't improving like light sensitivity, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, rapid heart rate, etc.

 

I think my anxiety hasn't completely gone away because the lack of the serotonin focus of the medication, since I understand bupropion acts on norepinephrine and dopamine, and in the past SSRIS and SNRIS took away the anxiety easy.

 

But if that's the case, why are SSRIS and SNRIS medications causing me side effects or worsening some symptoms if they didn't do it before?

 

Has anyone experienced something similar?

 

Of course, I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but I would like to hear some opinions since my symptoms haven't completely gone away with bupropion after like three months.

 

Should I ask my doctor to try again with a SSRI or SNRI and wait for the side effects to pass even though that kind of meds weren't causing me any major problems before?

 

P.S. In case it's important, I exercise a lot, eat well, and have always had very good results in medical tests.

 

Thank you very much for your help and time.","Anxiety"

I also visited a therapist for around 10 sessions, and while it did help, its expensive, so I stopped. After that, I started feeling much better, but sometimes I still get this sensation of dizziness, and I’m really afraid of dizziness. Once every six months or so, I wake up feeling like I’m going to fall to one side, like when I sleep on my right side, I feel like my head is going to fall to the right. This sensation continues until I fully wake up, and even after waking up, I feel like my spine is unstable, like I can’t balance properly.

I’m not sure what that feeling is, but it’s weird and happens in the back of my head. Sometimes, I also feel a strange sensation in my upper stomach area, like cold air running inside. When I do exercise, I fear doing neck rotations because of the same worry.

Sometimes I also feel like the floor is moving, though these occurrences are rare. But when they do happen, they’re really intense.

My anxiety though is a problem. I know a large part of it is caused by my work environment, but that’s not something I can change right now. 

My anxiety manifests a lot through physical symptoms, particularly chest pain and breathing issues (that mimic my asthma, which adds stress tbh).

SSRIs are a complete no go for me, tried many and they all did nothing. I’m on buspirone right now and it does pretty much nothing. I don’t want to take any benzos, and bc of asthma I can’t take propranolol. 

I have an appt with my psych and am planning on asking for new meds but she’s pretty pro-SSRI. I’m stuck with her for insurance reasons, so I’d like to go prepared with non-SSRI options.

"1750765178","A rant about anxiety","Hello everyone. This is a rant about anxiety and a little bit of a cry for help too. I will quickly go over my issues, so you will understand my point of view and where I am exactly right now. 

I have been dealing with anxiety since my teenage years, which will be around 15 years now. I am used to it, I have been managing it for years, it is probably some general anxiety disorder, which manifested in temporary obsessions with different kind of problems. It came in waves and it went away, daily, weekly, monthly ... 

But for the past two years it has been different. I have developed restroom anxiety, no idea what it triggered it. Probably a combination of stress, my body sensation obsessions and a few other stuff. I have compulsions (going to bathroom even if I don't have to) and it is really tiring. This freaking thing does not go away and I don't know what exactly I am doing or not doing.  


I have my own therapist, we discussed the issue, I know thee root problem (shame), I know that I just have to accept it, but I just can't get past it. Like I would logically understand what I have to do, but I just can't. I am stuck in a loop. It get a little better, and then it gets worse and it goes in a circle. 

I was prescribed antidepressants, but I don't take them since I am terrified of side effects. I would rather live with this (I still somehow think that it is better to live this way that to regret fucking my life up even more). And I know that it could potentially be good for me, but I really can't. At this point I am really lost. 

The worst part is that no one understands. When I want to share something, I just feel more dumb, like how can I have this tiny problem I am obsessing with it when people have real problems. 

I still have one thing to try, meditation. I am really bad at sticking with new habits, so that's why I still have not tried it. I know I have to go through it, to learn to live with it and to just observe. But it is so damn hard.

Before you say anything, I am exercising, I have a good life, a good partner, a nice job, a lot of hobbies. I think that is why it is even harder. I can't enjoy things I have and it is eating me alive. 

I don't even know what is the point of this rant. Maybe just wanted to let something out, maybe I just want to hear your experiences. Thank you for reading this. ","Anxiety"

"1750784797","Constant fatigue, mental overload, and disconnection from myself – does anyone else feel this way?","Hi everyone,
This is my first time posting here. I’m writing because I’m trying to understand what’s happening to me, and maybe connect with others who feel the same.

I’m 29 and, from the outside, I live a “healthy” life: I sleep 7.5 hours a night, I barely drink (2–3 drinks max, once a month), and I try to take care of myself. Yet I wake up every morning completely exhausted, as if I hadn’t slept at all. It’s not just physical – it’s like a constant mental fog that never lifts.

I’ve explored some medical causes. I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea, but not severe enough to need treatment. I also have dust mite allergies and started desensitization. My sleep is extremely light, and it’s become a point of tension in my relationship: the slightest sound wakes me, especially in the early part of the night, and when that happens, I can’t fall back asleep. Strangely, if I wake up later in the night, I fall asleep again easily.

At work, I’m seen as sharp, efficient, fast. But in my head, it’s constant chaos. When I get home, my brain keeps spinning. I jump between small tasks, unable to focus, like I’m afraid of forgetting something. I start unpacking my bag, realize I need to do laundry, go to the kitchen to get detergent, forget why I’m there, unload the dishwasher instead, remember the laundry again… and so on. It’s like my working memory is constantly overwhelmed, and I can’t stay present on one task.

To make things worse, I feel this almost compulsive need to get everything done the moment I get home, as fast as possible, in a weird state of tension – as if I could finally relax once it’s all done. But that moment of rest never truly comes. It feels almost pathological – like I’m running toward peace that always stays out of reach.

And even when I do sit down, I can’t mentally unwind. I start scrolling, searching random stuff online, watching videos… anything to avoid sitting in silence. I feel like I’ve lost access to calmness, or that I’m running from myself.

I also feel completely disconnected from who I am. I have a hard time setting boundaries or making choices. I just follow the flow of work, chores, fatigue… but if someone asked me “what would bring you joy?” or “what do you want to do this weekend?”, I honestly wouldn’t know. It’s like I’ve lost my ability to want.

Something else that weighs heavily on me: I often hold myself back from enjoying time with friends. I’d love to let go, stay up late, drink more, just be in the moment – but I know the aftermath is brutal. Just one night of excess hits me with days of fatigue and a sharp drop in mood. So I stay “reasonable,” go home early, keep things under control – and as a result, I end up feeling frustrated, out of sync, and often left out.

Social situations also drain me more and more. I’m okay when there’s a goal or structure (like a game), but small talk exhausts me. Talking about myself makes me anxious, being the center of attention too. People often tell me to “just relax” or “let go,” but honestly, I no longer know how. It’s not a mindset – it feels like I’ve lost the ability to access that state.

So I’m wondering:
Does anyone else experience something similar?
Could this be ADHD, burnout, hypersensitivity, or something else entirely?
Have you found anything that helped you reconnect with yourself, find peace, or even just breathe again?

You want to continue with your life just as other people get to but when you try to people start complaining that they feel anxious and depressed and life sucks again.

You think maybe you should stop trying to focus at all on how you’re affecting people and just do what you want and not care if you’re causing people to have “bad days” because you should prioritize yourself. But once you in a while you decide to check what people are saying on forums. You start to feel a bit mad at everyone because you know they don’t actually have “anxiety” or “depression” but you are making them feel ways in which makes them think they do. You feel mad because they are so anxious/depressed and you wish they would stop feeling that way. You feel mad because you know everyone in the world is feeling the way they are but they are able to get along fine with life but these people can’t/won’t. ","Anxiety"
"1750769657","my friend wont talk to me now?","Hey so I (24F) met up with a friend (29M) yesterday and we met up to get drinks, we then went to his place to smoke weed, ended up watching stupid tiktoks and scrolling away it was a lazy way of spending time while high. I was very giddy and laughing all the time, but my brain was telling me something was wrong with the way I was being percieved... Maybe I am wrong, maybe it is the weed making me paranoid?

I ended up heading home alone that day, he usually walks with me to the station, this time he did not, it was 1am by the time I got home, never recieved a text from him since. I texted him once hours ago and he hasnt replied.

"1750783104","Setback after success","I've struggled on and off with Panic/GAD since \~2019, which got significantly better before a big setback in October of last year when my dad got sick. Since then, I've made tremendous progress since then, and even travelled across the country for a work trip, something I thought would be impossible, and felt pretty anxiety free for the most part. 

When I got back, I was working at the library Monday and started to spiral into panic. My usual pattern came back: my arms feel numb, I feel distant, I feel overwhelmed/unreal, I feel like I'm going to have a seizure (have never had one). The rest of the day I just felt off, I still worked and went to volunteering in the evening, which I feel like is a big success and something I wouldn't do months back. But it's still hard thinking I've made so much progress and it can still come sneaking back. I don't want to lose all the hard work I've done.

im f15, but i started thinking about death like this since i was around 9? and these don’t occur during the school year because i’m so busy w/ friends and schoolwork.

"1750724451","I feel like my life is ruined","(29M)

I don’t even really know where to start. I’ve had anxiety most my life and the first panic attack I ever had was in 5th grade and I stayed panicked for the rest of the school year. My mom put me in therapy and that’s eventually what helped. 

At 20 years old I had another serious lapse in mental health and was inconsolable for weeks/months. I got on meds and again all was okay. 

Then it was my first job out of law school where I had yet another mental break where I got on meds and felt fine. 

My mom passed in May 2023, I coped with it by smoking weed and pretending I’m fine and I never got help for it. In 2024 I found out my fiancée of 10 years has been unfaithful and the relationship ended. 2 of my pillars in my formative years of life gone in 11 months. 

Now 3 years later I’m at possibly the worst I’ve ever felt. I have this panic and anxiety that there’s just no self soothing for. I can’t do anything to escape this feeling. I live alone, work an incredibly stressful job with stressful deadlines and the weight of billable hours on me all the time. When I’m anxious I have this constant tight chest that makes me feel like I can’t breathe sometimes and there’s nothing I can do when it happens to get it to stop except try to do breathing exercises. 

I just got back on lexapro today and started therapy last week and I’m just hoping somewhere along the way that I can put my life back together because right now I don’t have any joy, I dread every day because I wake up and have the “oh no I have to feel this excruciating feeling all day long with no break” pop into my head immediately. It’s exhausting and debilitating. 

I’m at my wits end. I was prescribed Wellbutrin thinking that would make things better but I ended up with just suicidal thoughts and an inability to get out of bed. I feel like my life is ruined. I can normally see a light at the end of the tunnel but I’ve been in this tunnel for months and there’s no light anywhere. I’m not going to hurt myself but there’s so many days where I just wish I could be somewhere else and not have to go through this anymore. 

I don’t really know what the point of this but I’m hoping maybe someone can say something to help. Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: never been this miserable in my life. Feeling stuck and trapped.

My anxiety is triggered now when my sons come home to visit from college. When they left it absolutely broke me, and we've figured out why, but that doesn't always ""fix"" things. It just makes me understand.

But now, when they come home, almost immediately after they've settled in, or we've hugged hello, I have to excuse myself, or find my wife while I cry my eyes out. Same thing happens when they leave.

"1750778501","Covid causing me anxiety and lack of sleep","

Hello I am 19f and on my fourth day of Covid and strep. This is my first time with Both and tested positive on Sunday at the er. I’m here because I’ve noticed that although I do feel physically tired I am struggling to fall asleep. As well as increasing my anxiety 10x by night fall.

I love my sleep and although I am a night owl on normal occasions I do tend to fall asleep fairly quickly and stay that way for a good 6-8 hours maybe more on weekends.

And since I’ve gotten covid I cannot sleep more that 3 hours and it takes almost the entire night to fall asleep.

And then the worst part is that I just feel this heavy weight of anxiety and panic in my chest that doesn’t go away at all. So put those two together and you basically have a nightmare scenario and a battle of should I go to the doctor or no. But no I am technically fine but I am very very nervous about the lack of sleep.

Last night I tried NyQuil but it only made me and my symptoms worse like scarily worse. I was so dizzy and I’m pretty sure I was hearing some auditory hallucinations. 

I’m very nervous right now is this normal with COVID? And if so what should I do? 

I’m taking amoxicillin, and Benadryl as prescribed and that’s it for right now.

Edit: I forgot to add that I while I’m not feeling too well I don’t have a fever or any sort of headache or chills. I’m really struggling with my sinuses tho it feels like my nostrils are closed but I can still breathe ok through them. Im just worried as to why I can’t sleep if my main problem is intense anxiety and panic and a stuffy nose at night. ","Anxiety"

I feel so behind but I am trying to learn acceptance (it’s my responsibility to heal and I am on my own path) and I want to get the degree and then travel, maybe do a master etc but I am so stuck, also my degree would not be very useful for work (but for other stuff) but I want it for me (I switched degree this year). I like studying, I am a fast learner, I have no issues understanding the materials. But I just can’t. I freeze, when the exam is near I sleep 12-13 hours per day, I binge eat and watch Netflix and I feel like I am not here, daydreaming, derealization and all, I don’t sleep and I hate myself, I am too ashamed to go to the library because you can see I am a little bit weird. My general anxiety is also triggered (I am so much better about everything but school).

I am also sad because my friends are all graduating with their master’s and I will be the only one still in school (and I am still in my undergraduate’s). I am so anxious about the future, money, war, AI, and I feel so useless.

"1750776098","Ny anxiety has slowly progressed to the point of near-breakdown","Hi everyone. I’m new here. 
I’ll start by saying that I’ve been reading other posts and it’s been very helpful. I’m here because I feel lost and alone, and a little embarrassed. I’m now 25yo, and I’ve dealt with some anxiety my whole life, but it’s always been manageable. I might need a day here or there to recuperate, but I’ve always been able to rationalize and get back on track.

This last year I’ve dealt with some normal life changes - I moved out, my job has become more stressful after my boss left, and experienced some depression due to some friendship stuff. I could feel myself slowly becoming more and more anxious this year, but I didn’t really want to deal with it. After coming back from a week-long vacation, I went back to work and had my first panic attack. I’d never experience anything like it, and it terrified me. I have an understanding employer, I explained everything and he wants to work with me, and I’m very grateful for that. I do feel stressed at my job, and partially it’s because I’ve taken on responsibilities that no one else knows anything about. But, I’ve explained that to my boss, and I’ve been trying to rationalize with myself that it’s ok that I don’t know every next step. But I tend to get panicky now when met with something I’m unfamiliar with. 

But since the panic attack, it’s like every stressful thing puts me in fight or flight mode. I have been to the dr (finally bit the bullet) and I started on Lexapro. I’m also seeing a therapist today (virtually). Since starting the medication last week, I took off work for 3 days because I couldn’t handle the idea of leaving home and dealing - I was in shambles, crying, unable to breathe properly, my throat felt tight. 
Having to request time off to deal with this made me feel guilty. And embarrassed. I live a good life, I have a wonderful family and friends, all who are extremely supportive. 

I just want to hear from others that may be experiencing the same thing. What helped you get back on track? How did you deal with guilt?  Is there anything you can recommend for morning anxiety - I tend to wake up with racing thoughts and that tight feeling in my throat. 

Wishing everyone well, and super appreciate of anything you can share!","Anxiety"
"1750760164","My anxiety just potentially ruined my friendship for being too overbearing/obsessive...How to best move forward?","I [33M] have a friend [32F] who I’ve known for 15+ years. We live long distance and established connection again a couple of years ago. In that time, we’ve texted almost every day, had phone calls about 2x per week, and I even went to visit her last winter so she could show me around her town.

While there was no sign that anything would escalate into a serious relationship, I was creating situations in my head that made me believe it could be possible. I have strong feelings for this person, but I know she won’t reciprocate. I’ve never told her what I really think of our friendship.

Lately, especially over the last several months, I became more and more obsessive. I would send multiple messages over the course of a couple of days without a response, then have racing thoughts about why she isn’t replying. I’d check to see if she added any followers on Instagram and would want to know why she’s doing that instead of replying to me. Most of my free time was being spent wondering what else she could be doing.

I recently went through a layoff at work and started a new job a few weeks ago. The anxiety from this has made my behavior more severe. As I’ve been navigating these life changes I became even more fixated on getting her validation and attention. I couldn’t go more than a few minutes without checking my phone to see if she’s reached out. My sleep and appetite suffered. I was suddenly very distracted and scatter-brained with other people in my life because I was treating her as the only one whose opinion mattered.

This culminated in a rather unhealthy way recently. I noticed my conversations were becoming more one-sided. One day she mentioned she was hanging out with a guy she just met. Casual things like going to the beach, watching the sunset. My mind immediately went into overdrive and I felt an instant sense of jealousy and vulnerability. I wanted to know who this person was and whether this was going to be serious. As she was becoming less responsive to my messages, or at least just more brief than before, I felt her sort of slipping away and I didn’t know how to handle it.

I can’t fully explain why, but something told me to look her up on the dating apps to see how she’s presenting herself. I took my Hinge profile and set it to her town. I spent several minutes swiping to try to find her, and eventually I did. Nothing surprising or crazy. I left my location as hers, and I’m almost certain she found me on the app as she was swiping and got surprised/freaked out.

My messages since then have gone completely unanswered, calls go right to voicemail. I’m not blocked on social media but am likely muted or restricted. I sent her an apology on facebook about how needy I’ve been recently (without explicitly mentioning this latest example) and it hasn’t been read yet. I feel terrible for letting this get to the point where I’ve potentially lost a friend. My social circle isn’t that large to begin with, so this intensifies those feelings of rejection and abandonment. Unfortunately, I also think if I kept obsessing in this way for much longer, it was likely bound to culminate in something like this. I haven’t been approaching any of this in a healthy way.

This has opened my eyes to how my anxiety can seize me with an iron grip. I’ve never had it treated but I’m ready to do that now by looking into therapy. It's something I've only considered one other time when a family member passed away, but I never followed through. Now I really do believe I need a professional opinion to help explore why I feel these things and how to properly process them.

I’ve also realized I'll need to gradually build up my social circle to have more quality, supportive friendships. I’m considering volunteering at local organizations and being more proactive with reaching out to people I haven’t heard from in a while to see if they’d like to catch up.

Being blocked/muted can actually free myself now to not worry about seeking that little “rush” when I get a message or call from her. On the one hand I’m truly disappointed in myself, but on the other it could be just what I need to allow me to focus and learn about what I have to do to get in a better headspace. I’d appreciate anyone’s thoughts on how to best move forward or if you have any similar experiences to draw from. I’ve been sitting with these thoughts all night and need to get them out there.

"1750773425","Blood in stool caused by anxiety?","Hi there, im writing here because im totally lost to be honest. 
To start off, I'm an 18 year old male with no family history of cancer
To simplify it a lot, I've had some kind illness that caused me to have very bad diarrhea. After a week or so after i ate spicy food and i saw a very very small spot of something red in my stool. Being the hypochondriac i am i went to the doctor and had all sorts of tests done. I had stool, blood and urine tests, and a Digital rectal examination. During this time i was incredibly anxious, barely being able to get out of bed let alone do anything productive. I barely even ate. I had multiple panic attacks and i was over all in a horrible mood. All the tests came back negative. By the time i was done i hadn't had blood for 2 months, and my doctor said they can't really send me to anymore tests since there's no reason to, so i was sorta convinced I'm fine. Well, later that week i went to kfc with my friends and i had way more blood than ever before, or after since. I tried to brush it off, saying maybe i just got a fissure from the rectal examination, but after that, almost every week, almost precisely a week later, i had blood. I began dieting and using hemorrhoids cream, my reasoning being that a rectal exam would miss an internal hemorrhoid, so i must have had that. I was still incredibly anxous, fearing the worst (cancer [yes i know it's stupid im 18 and have no other symptoms]) i had a calprotectin test that came back negative as well, so i went and had another rectal exam, which found nothing, then i had a rectoscopy. Neither of them found anything.

Now here's the part I'm confused about:
My doctor said that due to my age and lack of symptoms, it's probably a stress related. He insisted that stress can cause blood in stool, but I've never heard of anything like that, even though i was researching the topic a ton since i was incredibly anxious about it. I know I'm not a doctor, thats why i want to ask if anyone here has ever experienced something like this? Pure stress causing blood in stool.

I find it odd, because even though i never heard of anything like this, his advice seemed to work. I just tried stressing about it less and it seemed to work. I've gone 3 whole weeks without having any blood! Unfortunately last night i had a pretty bad wave of anxiety due to unrelated personal stuff that lasted for a couple of hours, and lo and behold, today i woke up and had a bloody stool. Can it really be stress related? Everything points to this being the case but wherever i search online they say stress alone can't cause blood. The only thing similar is that ibs maybe sometimes can cause blood, but i don't really have cramping or anything, maybe gas or frequent stools when im stressed but nothing severe...

I feel totally lost right now...the doctor said to just relax and continue life as normal, but to go back if there is still blood and that he'll do a colonoscopy

Now im not really sure what to do...should i go back because there was blood or not because it really could just be stress like he said.

So please, if anyone had anything similar please tell me, just so that i can know that it's not bullshit or something. I want to trust my doctor and i realize he knows way more than i do but doubt just keeps crawling back into my mind

I feel like I am slowly going crazy. My diagnosis is GAD and severe health anxiety along with a few panic attacks here and there. For most of the time I was fine, I was on 10mg of Citalopram for about 4-5ish years. I did feel quite fine back then, yes there were ocassional panic attacks here and there but I never had to turn to my SOS medication (bromazepam). 

This year however I hit a rough patch when having a health scare which sent me spiraling and had to leave work for month and a half, I came back and felt a bit better but I feel like the higher dosage of Citalopram (currently 20mg) did really nothing for me, if anything I loose control quite easier. I can't seem to stop thinking about my body constantly failing me whenever I have the slightest pain in my body or the tiniest headache. I always think that it's my blood pressure spiking and that I'll get a stroke/heart attack and die. I feel so extremely aware of everything it's literally destroying my life. 

  
I eat some food that had been sitting out for a little bit, I freak out cause I'm definitely having food poisoning. I get the slightest headache, I freak out cause I think I'm having a stroke. My face gets sunburnt, I get convinced it's not a sunburn and my face is flushed like that because of extremely high blood pressure and I might die any minute. These things always send me into overdrive, my heart starts to run a marathon and I feel faint. It's honestly so shit. 

I know that pills won't magically fix everything, it's all about the mind and how we deal with these situations I do realise everything, but I feel like ever since I spiraled back into the toxic mindset I can't get out and my medication just isn't working anymore as it used to, should I contant my psychiatrist and try him to get me on something different?

"1750769756","First time seizure-like symptoms, unsure if its anxiety and/or sleep apnea","Hello, everyone. I'd only like to ask if this is likely anxiety, panic attacks, or sleep apnea. Because of how similar the symptoms are from panic attacks to seizures or something, I'm not quite sure and I haven't gone to the doctors to get assessed since we're lacking finance to consider and I haven't told this to my parents about this.

Yesterday, I slept around 7-8pm, woke up at 10pm, slept again and I woke up around 1am(?), then the moment I was conscious, I involuntarily took a big deep breath before proceeding to uncontrollably shaking or twitching? I was aware of what's happening, but I couldn't control anything at all, my eyes are closed but I can't open them. It only lasted a few seconds, afterwards it's as if nothing happens, but I was really terrified and confused of what had happened, it's also the first time that had happened to me. I was laying down on a soft-ish-hard surface with a pillow. I fell asleep after calming down and since then, I haven't experienced anything like that anymore. I planned on telling this to my parents, but in terms of health-related, they discard it most of the time, so I haven't bothered telling them yet.

For context though, the reason why it could be anxiety, is because I've been stressed so much in recent weeks, so much work had to be done, lack of sleep, and adding my health anxiety for searching so much of whatever symptoms and diseases I'm having, and it's still ongoing. As for sleep apnea, I do notice I take deep breaths in some points when I do sleep because I felt like I forgot to breathe.","Anxiety"
"1750768991","Health anxiety anxiety","I’ve been struggling with anxiety for the past three years, ever since the death of my best friend,.It started with chest pain, and I thought it was a heart attack. I did over 20 ECGs, troponin tests, and everything else—but my heart was fine. Then I thought it might be kidney failure, so I got ultrasounds and X-rays, but my kidneys were in perfect shape. After that, I started worrying about my liver, but all the LFTs came back normal. I even had pain in my spleen, but another ultrasound showed it was fine. I’ve had multiple chest scans and countless blood tests—everything has been normal.

Still, I started having panic attacks. My anxiety has never gone away in these past three years, and no one really seems to understand what I’m going through. My family moved to another country for a better future, but since we arrived, my mind has been racing for the past six months. I keep thinking I have leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer—every possible cancer. But my blood tests aren’t just okay—they’re very good. Yet, I’m exhausted. I live with 24/7 shortness of breath, chest pain that comes and goes, hot flashes, body aches. I feel like I don’t want to live anymore. I haven’t felt truly happy in three years. I spend most days lying in bed. When I go out, everything seems blurred. I feel confused and lightheaded.


My father is very supportive—he loves me deeply and has always given me everything I wanted, even when his income was limited. No matter what I asked for, he made sure I had the best. I know how much he has sacrificed for me. Now, it’s my time to take responsibility. He’s getting older, and I need to take care of my siblings and our family. All I want is to give my father some happiness—that’s all that matters to me.

"1750765912","is this normal or?","i've saw some people talk about this issue in this subreddit so i thought i would come here because im like kind of worried rn,,, tldr at the bottom ;^_^

basically im 15 and i have this thing where like im DEEPLY afraid of hearts (the organ) in general, every time even in class i hear anything mentioned about a heart or even a simple beatinf sound i think im dying. it affects my sleep a lot (such as, some nights i literally cant sleep at all if theres ONE sound that sounds similar to a heartbeat like pumping or beating), if i feel any chest pain i would think my heart is like rlly,,,, unhealthy? idk i feel like im having a heart attack which makes me rlly scared. im super afraid of it, sometimes when i have panic attacks i would think its my heart which is 'dying' not like the panic itself through my body yk? i cant drink matcha, coffee, anything with caffeine because once my heart beats it affects me a ton.

sometimes i'll start sweating, feeling dizzy, or just. yeah. stuff like that when i feel palpitations THIS HAPPENS ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. i would think its like skipping a beat so it scares me, i tend to have high levels of anxiety or try to make everything perfect (or keep everything in place i rather just not get anything out of order) in fear that if smth happens my heart will beat and it will cause me to feel extreme fear.

in the present time i really hate this because like it  rlly ruins my life, sports are a big no i do play badminton sometimes but i actively have to take breaks or stop to check my heartbeat, walking sucks i'll check it mid walk esp more embarrassing with my friend around :( (they dont take it seriously and think its stupid). so far nobody in my family has this issue so im sure this isnt genes or some family background, none of my friends experiences this, it just feels like irl its just me who experiences this (which makes it worse bc i feel like im faking it) but anyways im pretty sure i gained this during kindergarten? when we learnt how to check our heartbeat and i got extremely scared, got even worse throughout uhm primary school bc like that few years was when i learnt that oh if your heart stops u die and i got super scared (i fear death as in i dont want the pain nor to cease to exist), and yeah science class rlly messed me up bad with all the stuff about hearts. it also got worse today because i saw smth related to hearts and death on tiktok which caused my heart to beat rlly fast and i had to actually try to calm down for about 20 mins (im still rlly scared btw but its a bit better now...) i try to avoid all thoughts about it as it rlly scares me badly but yeah thats my experience im not looking for a diagnosis maybe just a name or something that can relate to my uh issue? i heard its called cardiophobia but im not sure i dont wanna assume i havent went to the doctors bc 1. no money 2. im scared of doctors

tldr: im 15 and i am deathly afraid of hearts and think any pain to my body is a heart attack, i cannot hear beating sounds otherwise i go into a panic attack (which i mistake as another heart attack but its not after i talked to someone), happened during kindergarten and only gotten worse during the years. dont want a diagnosis just want a name but i heard its cardiophobia but dont wanna assume ^_^","Anxiety"

"1750761136","Are the doctors wrong?","Im a 23 year old male thats been dealing with anxiety for a few years now. I used to smoke weed alot back in 2022 to help, to which I had to stop due to chest palpitations that I start getting from it. Now these chest palpitations felt very scary, flutters that just never went away for multiple days. I went to the emergency room when It got really bad to which after a few test, they chalked it up as anxiety induced. I told them it only happened because of my smoking so they told me to just simply stop. They said the weed couldve made the anxiety that I already had worse so cutting back might be the best solution. 

Months go past and these chest palpitations DONT go away. My parents tell me to “stay calm and breathe” like im not already doing that. I dont even be anxious half of the time but they never go away. I also get CRAZY chest pain and other weird bodily symptoms. Obviously all of this can make anyone think somethings is seriously wrong. In 2023 I go to a cardiologist to which they put me on a heart monitor. After wearing it for a few months they also said that everything was perfectly fine. 

At this point I really just told myself to trust the doctors and just wait for the chest palpitations to pass. Trust the doctors that your CRAZY chest pain is just anxiety. Trust that the doctors did they due diligence in making sure your fine. 
As the years go pass more different bodily feelings arise. A new thing I deal with are chest vibrations near where my heart is which is also very scary. All of these things play a huge part in why my anxiety has gotten worse of the years. I feel physical symptoms and my brain doesn’t agree that its just anxiety. I always think to myself “What if the doctors are wrong and one day im just gonna have a huge heart attack or something” …I always think to myself I must have some weird rare heart disorder or something because why does this happen to me? I bring myself to reddit because I see alot of people deal with similar issues that I do, which gives me more comfort than what the doctor says which is backwards but thats just the way it is. Eventually I will go see another cardiologist to get more test done but until then Im gonna attempt to trust that its just anxiety.","Anxiety"

A whole charade went down, but eventually after dealing with this for ~20 minutes i called 911 in fear of this possibly being the start of something serious, but they checked my vitals and told me i was all good. 

The thing that really made this bad though was that it was literally out of nowhere, and ive never ever had this happen before. I was in a great mood and then it went downhill. So im left wondering, is this a thing that happens? Did i subconsciously associate smelling something burnt toast adjacent to having a stroke and that triggered something to have a panic attack?

"1750759939","TW: First ever panic attack(s?)","I 23M just had my first full blown panic attack(s?). It lasted about 20 minutes total, with a brief pause about halfway through. I’ve been in a deep depression for about 4 months now. I was crying myself to sleep when it happened and by the time I noticed I was having one, it was in full swing. Shallow uneven breaths, shaking, the inability to move, mixed in with my occasional sobs and a vice grip like feeling clamping down on my chest. At one point I was frozen, literally unable to move my body while shaking, legs locked out straight with my arms close to my chest as I lay in bed looking at the ceiling. When the brief pause occurred, I got up to walk around my room to try and snap out of it. That’s when it kicked in again. I couldn’t move as I felt my breathing quicken and my chest tighten. I don’t know how I was able to but I crawled back into my bed. It was like I was moving through wet cement, literally fighting my body to get back into bed. I just curled up and tried to ride it out as best as I could. When it finally ended I felt exhausted emotionally and physically, was sweating profusely, and I’m still shaking as I’m typing this. It is currently 5:05 am and I have not slept. I don’t think I’ll be able to. Since I don’t have anyone else to talk to I figured I’d come on here and share my story.

"1750758792","Which med, supplement or substance helped you being more sociable and talkative?","Which med, supplement or substance helped you being more sociable and talkative?

I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I can think. Diagnosed since I was 15. I already tried many different meds as well as therapies but still nothing was able to get my symptoms into control or make me functional. 

Social anxiety is the biggest issue as it‘s additionally the main cause of my depression. 

Just thinking about the next days or years makes me depressed because of the thoughts how to get through that social event, that chat with a friend, that meeting, that career path, that romantic relationship and so on because EVERYTHING has socializing in it. 

Socializing affects every aspect of life. My brain chemistry hinders me in every aspect of socializing making me very restricted. Being aware of these restrictions in every aspect of life (career, love life, friendships, sports, hobbies, passions etc.) makes me very depressed. Depression again feeds the social anxiety by zero energy, motivation, drive, anhedonia and so on.

What meds helped you the most with being better in socializing and also having more fun and drive to do so? 

Please be aware that I already tried following ones:
- 2 analytical depth psychological therapies
- 1 cognitive behavioral therapy
- SSRI/SNRIs: Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Duloxetine
- DNRI: Bupropion
- Neuroleptics: Promethazine, Quetiapine
- Tricyclic: Amitriptyline
- MAOI: Moclobemide
- Benzos: Diazepam, Lorazepam
- Gabapentinoids: Gabapentin, Pregabalin
- Others: Mirtazapine, Opipramol, Hydroxyzine

All were without any success in symptoms. Except for Pregabalin. But it‘s still not helping 100% or making life bearable - aside I don‘t think you can use that daily anyways.

Would love to read about your experiences and success with meds for sociability when suffering from depression and social anxiety or any other conditions.

I feel calm and ok and as though I can smoothly get through all the things without being inside my head or freaking out on the inside or any issues at all.. it’s how I suppose people without anxiety feel, it’s such a freeing and light feeling.

And when she was a little  baby my sister called her my cousins name because she was acting like my cousin. She stopped and looked at my sister and we asked her if her name was hayleigh and she would kind of act odd.. I completely forgot about it until recently. And my sister called her it again and she started laughing. My daughter knows: yes, no, I know, thank you, one, two, Dada, mimi, papa. 

I was playing with her earlier and my partner called them hayleigh also remembering the joke from when she was a few months old and I asked her 
""Is your name hayleigh?"" She said yes I may have went ghost investigator and asked some odd questions but got weirded out by her responses. 

""Are you a baby?"" Yeah ""were you always a baby?"" No. ""We're you an adult?"" No ""were you a teanager"" yeah. ""Did you like your life?"" No ""do you like your life now?"" Yeah. 

All around it just made me anxious thinking about this conversation we had with her earlier. She is really good about differentiating yes and no questions. Like if she gets choked up on food and you ask if she's OK? She will typically respond yeah after she's through coughing and stuff. Just as an example

Maybe it's just the anxiety but I'm feeling weirded out by my kid. ","Anxiety"
"1750727379","I randomly wake up at night with restlessness and a weird sense of doom — is this anxiety?","This happens to me rarely, but mostly during colder conditions — like when I sleep with the AC on or during rainy season. I'll suddenly wake up in the middle of the night with a strange feeling of restlessness and an unexplainable sense of doom or unease. I know nothing is actually wrong, but the feeling is very real in the moment.

I usually end up walking around, drinking water, or using my phone to distract myself. Sometimes I manage to fall back asleep, but it often returns — ruining my entire night’s sleep.

It’s hard to describe — I’m fully awake and aware, but I feel an irrational fear or dread. Could this be some form of anxiety? Or maybe something else like temperature-related discomfort or a sleep issue?

Would appreciate any insights or if anyone has experienced something similar.","Anxiety"

I’ve been on vacation for 2 days now and it has been the worst. I’m not even sure what I’m worried about but I get so worried about whatever it is it physically makes my stomach upset. Like excruciating nausea. I’ve been to the doctor and they put me on 10 mg hydroxyzine. I feel like at this point my doctor is just trying things. I’ve been put on all kinds of medication for the past 4 months to “see what would happen” said specially by my doctor. I feel like she’s gaslighting me atp. I’ve gone 4 month without a single day of no nausea and I’m just tired of living like this.

"1750734704","22 years old with health anxiety","Hi I 22F have anxiety most of my life, but up until this last year never had a lot of issues with it. It all sorta started when I started drinking more when I turned 21 and experimenting more with drugs. I got really into snow and was doing very heavy drinking benders for the majority of my 21st year. Eventually about 4 months ago I got clean from snow and started working at moderating my drinking. Since then I’ve been having episodes of sudden chest pain, trouble breathing, dissociation, back and neck pain, almost like gasping of breathing and absolute impending doom. First time it happened I had 2 drinks and started feeling impending doom and trouble breathing, I was shaking and weak pacing around my apartment for hours before giving in and going to the hospital where they did a EKG and found nothing wrong with me. At that point I was hoping it would be a one off but the anxiety just kept progressing. Maybe once a week I’d go into spells of breathing issues for hours and hours then eventually tire myself out enough or take myself to the hospital. I’ve also started getting random hives from what my friend who’s a psychologist is possibly anxiety related. The breaking point really was when I went to visit my partner in Alaska where he lived a hour away from any medical center and was having them every day one even over eating an English muffin. But worse and worse some with no reason but stemming from thinking I’m having an allergic reaction or heart attack. Most “attacks” last hour and only start calming down when I hit two hours after eating when there’s no possibility of allergic reaction or eventually become restless enough to sleep it off. I’ve tried hydroxizine, weed, adivan and quitting drinking completely. I feel like I’m burdening my partner and everyone in my life. I can’t help but google my symptoms and self diagnosis. I’m scared to be alone in case it isn’t anxiety but I’m scared to be around people to dampen the mood. I can’t help tell my partner is pulling away, I’m debating on doing therapy but I feel like I’m gonna overthink it. It’s almost like my anxiety mimics what I’m afraid is going on with my body. It’s odd because I never used to be afraid of death but I’m terrified now. Idk what I want to come from this post but if someone else is going through this I’d love advice the 3-3-3 method doesn’t work for me and I’m not religious and not really want religious advice.

I love her more than anything, and I’ve stood by her through all of it. But over the years, I’ve picked up my own anxiety, and there are times I just need someone outside our daily world to talk to. No judgment. No expectations. Just someone real.

She actually told me I should find someone to talk to—joked that I need someone I can safely complain about her to (with love, of course). So here I am.

Not looking to disrupt anyone’s life or mine. Just hoping to find a genuine connection with someone kind and open, who understands what it’s like to carry emotional weight and still try to keep showing up every day.

"1750729922","Venting and my doom","First let me (25f) say I love my life and enjoy it. I have a job that I love and enjoy. It’s work from home but I feel like I connect with my coworkers. I talk to someone daily from work on the phone. I have cousins, siblings, other family, and friends who I talk to daily. Who go on adventures and go out to eat. I have pets and take care of them and play with them. I garden and get a large  and I watch tv and read and knit. I am currently working on my masters and am doing great with that.

But I just have this feeling of doom and I am behind in life. Like we are all doomed anyway so what’s the point. I try connect with new friends and people and find myself not. I feel like I am not important in the grand scheme of things. I am no one’s first choice. No one reaches out. I have to invite myself to things. I have had no long term boyfriend and am terrified I’ll never find someone. I’ll never find a man who wants to have a family but also loves me for me. I’ll never own a house. Or be able to pay off my car. I am afraid that my job will fire me even though I have done nothing wrong. I’ll never meet my professional goals even though I am actively working toward them. I am never the first choice to call about something or some adventure. I am afraid I could disappear and no one would notice because I am just replaceable in everyone’s eyes. No one cares when I do well at work or my class. No one wants to hear about my garden or my pets. No one cares when I send them stuff that reminds me of them or when I send them something funny. I just do it and get no reaction. I don’t talk to anyone for a week and no one questions it. Despite talking every day to them most of the times.

I do enjoy my life and am okay a lot of the time. I am in therapy and have tried. I try so hard to not feel this way. But I feel like it never full clicks and I feel like for years I do good and this sinking feeling starts up again. It’s a cycle I do not know how to stop. I just want someone to enjoy life with me and care. I feel so alone. 

Does anyone have advice to stop this feel from cycling back? I am tired of feeling so alone. I thought I accepted it  a few years ago and feel okay most of the time but here it is again.

"1750727299","Panic Attacks?","Anyone have any helpful tips for panic attacks in the moment? 

(F34) and I have had them in just about every setting where it’s somewhat formal and quiet for about 20 years now. So, classes, meetings, weddings, funerals, even plays, graduations, performances.. I think you see what I mean. And oddly enough it doesn’t matter who I’m with or what the people are saying or even if I have to speak, etc. it’s more just the idea that I can’t leave (or it would be embarrassing/people would notice and then therefore if I sat down and thought again “oh god I’ve gotta leave”, it would really be noticeable if I left again). All very irrational, I know…

What’s also odd is that I’m an elementary school teacher and while I’m alone with the kids, teaching, it only very rarely happens. If the thought occurs to me, I will start to panic but usually something distracts me well enough or I just suffer through it. 

So, thankfully bc I was afraid to run out, or leave class, meetings, weddings etc. for so many years, I have done a TON of exposure therapy. And I of course take meds, but I’m trying to move away from them as I am way too reliant on them and have started to experience some withdrawal symptoms when I taken them a little less than normal. And I’m trying to get pregnant! I’ve tried deep breathing, in for whatever, out for whatever (can’t remember, haha) and that did help a bit, but not fully. 

Sorry this was so long! Any tips would be greatly appreciated! 

Tldr: have had panic attacks in quiet, formal settings for 20 yrs. In the last few years realized meds work wonders but have become reliant on them and want to move away from them a bit.

"1750703861","The stoner life is not for me","I'm one of those people who never listen to other people and only learn through experience (ie: the hard way). Two months ago, very early April, one of my friends told me that he had started using edibles from a recently opened dispensary. Up until that point, I'd avoided weed because I do not trust anything sold on the streets.

I decided to buy some on his recommendation. They were 1:1 CBD/THC hybrid edibles. The first time I took one, I had a brutal experience. It lasted 10 hours and I went from giggly to paranoid to hearing deep guttural breathing when alone, and then bliss.

I should have stopped then. I didn't. I continued taking them, justifying the bad experiences because I also had really good experiences.

This month, I decided to try Indica because I heard they provided a more relaxing high. They don't. In fact, these edibles are so much stronger that I have begun to dread taking any. I went from using one a day to one every few days, and now I nearly have a panic attack when I feel the effects coming on.

My OCD is unbearable when I am stoned. When I was a child, I had a strange fear of flowers. I would have intense intrusive thoughts of them coming to life. I grew out of this, but THC brought it all back. Certain images will cause me to jerk away in terror. I just can't. I don't know how to explain it. This doesn't happen to anyone else.

If I am home alone, and I know I am alone, I will be super prone to panic. The less said about night the better. If I am stoned after dark, I will feel dread like no other. I might have a panic attack thinking that it is dark because I am underwater, in a sinking ship. I'm not joking. That's where my thoughts go.

Hearing voices happens about 30% of the time, but it happens enough that I hate it. That deep, wet guttural breathing I heard the first time was accompanied by a feeling that I was being watched by some kind of entity. I was too scared to re-enter the home by myself.

Last week, I called 911 and went to the emergency room because the experience was so intense. This used to happen on a bimonthly cycle because my anxiety was so bad (and that was without weed involved).

The cognitive dissonance has been crazy because when people talk about weed, they prioritize good experiences and almost glorify the use of it. The dispensary workers told me that certain ""strains"" were better for anxiety. They're not.

The only source that gave me any kind of neutral, unbiased opinion was ChatGPT. It told me what my outpatient prescriber refused to. Every time I brought up weed, it would tell me to use extreme caution.

Well, I'm listening now. Today, I tossed the edibles. I am DONE.","Anxiety"

This all started probably 2 months ago. I became obsessed with thinking about a past partner of hers that I have known my whole and life and share mutual friends with. Started with worrying about what he might think or say about her and myself. This then turned into mental images, her leaving a bar with him, her being at his place and them having sex. Will think about this all day until I completely exhaust myself and eventually break down.

Early on in our relationship we both shared our experiences with different drugs. This was something I was comfortable with and it didn’t bother me until a week ago. Before I go into this I want to be clear, she is in no way addicted to any of these things she has done (ket, coke, mdma) and they are no longer part of our lives. Last week a friend of hers was telling a story about when they did coke in a nightclub bathroom. This sent my brain into overdrive!! The mental image of her in a nightclub bathroom snorting cocaine has been burning in my brain for days on end. It’s obviously not a deal breaker for me as I myself have dabbled with certain substances as well. Find it so frustrating that the mind can be subconsciously so hypocritical.

I’ve expressed all these thoughts/feelings to her and have been very clear that it is not her fault and is a me problem. She assured me that she would do whatever it took to help me and suggested that I try therapy as my parents went through a rough divorce in my teens and I’m not in contact with my mother at all after her affair became known to me.

This is someone that I want to be with. She’s caring, kind and most importantly supportive of me. Feeling a little guilty that I’m being overly sensitive and hypocritical to small moments in her past that have no serious threat to our relationship and the happiness we bring to each other. I believe that we can beat this! How do I overcome this? ","Anxiety"
"1750733327","My Life Doesn't Look Anything Like I Thought It Would","It's summer right now. It's early in the morning where I am. The first little bits of light are coming in. Everything still looks blue, but it's not dark anymore. It's the kind of sunrise you only get in summer where it's almost dark but not dark at the same time.

There's a smattering of birds chirping. Not many, but a few. And the rest of the world is quiet. Asleep.

Opening my window I was reminded of a moment just like this one. From back when I was 17.

I remember I was sleeping over at my first girlfriend's house. But I couldn't fall asleep. I spent much of the night reading ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay."" It was summer back then too and I remember looking out her window, out at the trees and the street. And seeing that same early sunrise. That seem blue world. Hearing the quiet of the world, the scattered chirping of a bird or two. As she was laying next to me, head burried into her pillow, sleeping.

It came back so vividly to me opening my window. And it just reminded me of a whole lot of things.

Back then I was just getting out of high school. I was going to go to college for the first time a month or two later. I had a girlfriend. Friends. I was young. A new chapter of my life was starting. I was more optimistic than I had been in a while about everything. Things seemed to be going better.

I had all of these ideas what my life would look like 10 years from then. I'd have a masters in psychology from my university. Maybe be pursuing a Phd. I had starting writing a novel for the first time. I wanted to complete that before I got out of college. I thought me and my girlfriend would probably be living together. Maybe married. Waking up next to each other like this every day.

But my life turned out nothing like that.

Me and that girlfriend broke up a few months later. My social anxiety and performance anxiety would proceed to make me stop going to classes about halfway through my first year of college. The friends I had, except for one, would all drift away. I would spend the next few years isolated, depressed and unable to go to college.

Eventually I'd find a psychologist who helped me. I'd start going back to college. Started to overcome my anxiety. Found a new girlfriend. Things were starting to improve. Then the pandemic hit and everything collapsed again.

I had to drop out of college right before graduating due to a mental breakdown. My girlfriend broke up with me. I couldn't find a job. And my book still wasn't finished at all. I fell back into a depression.

I still live with my parents. Still don't have a job. And while I found another girlfriend for a while, by now I'm single again. And that book still isn't done. I don't have the masters degree, let alone the Phd I wanted. No house.

Just depression and sadness. All alone.

All because of anxiety. My anxiety made it impossible to go to college at first. My anxiety made me have a mental breakdown during the pandemic that made me have to quit. My anxiety to this day has me isolated and unable to build the life I want. That and depression. A depression which isn't helped by this state.

I just... I had such a good idea of what my life was going to be like at 17, laying next to my girlfriend that day. Looking out at the blueish world, hearing the birds chirp now as I did then, my life is nothing like any of that.","Anxiety"

"1750730466","yawn feeling in throat. Anxiety or no?","has anyone ever experienced this feeling before? It's a ticklish and odd sensation in my throat that makes me yawn every other 3 minutes. It's the feeling of having to yawn, but it also feels like I need to cough. It's not painful, but it's very weird. it's like being tired but not tired. I can't find any other ways to explain this other than it feels like I have to yawn, but when I do, it's not satisfying and the feeling comes back, leading to more yawning. Sometimes it makes me forcefully cough or ""puff"" air out of my lungs, but the same feeling comes back. I've had this feeling for 2 days now, on and off.

I’m scared that the lowest level my anxiety will ever be at, will still be too strong for me to handle. I have days, weeks and sometimes months where the anxiety is manageable and life feels brighter again, but then all of a sudden I just feel awful again. I know that the anxiety will pause sooner or later, but I don’t want to live a life where I have to accept that eventually the anxiety will hit me and I’ll have to draw back from everything in my life to make sure I survive. It sounds exhausting and it already feels like a prison. I can’t go to school or work because the anxiety makes me home ridden sometimes so I can’t have obligations. What happens when I do have to get a job or go to school again? And I randomly get a huge wave of anxiety and I’ll have to leave? Many places would just fire people like that, or never hire them in the first place.

"1750728691","I gave so much of myself, I forgot to save anything for me.","I know this is a long read, but if you decide to stay with me, thank you in advance.

Being an introvert, I’ve never been one to share my troubles easily—not even with my closest friends. Although I’ve spent most of my career in public service, I’ve always cherished the quiet luxury of a private life. Tending to my cats, gardening, cooking, playing light sports, listening to music, and watching old films were some of the simple joys that gave me peace.

For years, I kept my hardships hidden behind a composed exterior, believing that strength meant silence and that duty required endurance. I grew used to carrying my burdens quietly, even as they multiplied behind closed doors.

And yet here I am, writing this—because I no longer have anyone to confide in.

In just a few weeks, I will be confronted with a much starker reality. On top of being broke, jobless, and drowning in debt, I now face the prospect of homelessness. It’s a frightening thought. Looking back, I realize this path was shaped by years of placing others’ needs above my own.

For a long time, I made a habit of prioritizing others, driven by empathy and a sincere desire to help. That mindset was deeply influenced by a lesson from one of my high school teachers, who encouraged us to live in service to others. I took those words to heart and made them a guiding principle. I believed that by supporting others, I could give my life greater meaning.

That belief stayed with me long after graduation. After college, I assumed the responsibility of supporting our youngest sibling through her education. In many Filipino families, it’s common for the elder sibling to step in when parents can’t shoulder the burden. So when I earned my professional license, I understood it was my turn.

With a modest salary that barely placed me within the lower middle class, I somehow managed to provide for six hungry stomachs: myself, my mom, my nephew, and three siblings. It felt as though I were raising a family of my own. Each month, my earnings went toward food, household supplies, tuition, allowances, and my mother’s medical needs. There were even times my mom asked for help on behalf of our relatives or her friends in need. Saving for myself became a distant dream.

Even so, my family never truly knew the extent of my financial struggle. I rarely said no to their requests, never revealed my distress in our conversations, and did everything I could to shield them from the worries I had silently chosen to bear. I always found ways to make ends meet—taking on side hustles and, more often than not, relying on credit just to get by. I kept telling myself, “Don’t worry—God will provide.”

Despite everything, I took pride in providing for them. I never asked my older siblings to share the weight as long as I had something in my pocket. Not one of them willingly offered even a single peso to ease my burden. Perhaps they believed I had limitless resources, that I could carry alone what should have been a shared responsibility. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt. They never asked how I was holding up. I now realize my silence may have been a mistake. Maybe I should’ve asked them to take on their share.

Then came the moment I hadn’t quite anticipated, though deep down, I saw it coming. After six years of service, I was told I could no longer renew my contract. As painful as it was, I didn’t resist. In some ways, I even welcomed it.

By then, the job had taken more than it had given. I had once believed it would fulfill me, as it aligned with a long-held passion of mine. But over time, things strayed far from what I originally signed up for. The workplace had grown increasingly polarized, fractured by internal politics. The institution itself reeked of corruption and self-serving agendas. Policies that looked good on paper only created more red tape and systemic inefficiency. The idea of work-life balance had vanished. My core responsibilities shifted toward mundane clerical tasks—work that felt less meaningful and increasingly draining.

Alongside the growing pressure was emotional turmoil. I became entangled in a relationship with a coworker that, while it began with sincerity, soon unraveled into something scandalous and painful. I never imagined I would be caught in something like that. What I thought was a genuine connection only deepened my sense of isolation and regret. That bitterness became yet another reminder of my quiet misery.

The exhaustion, the betrayal, the loss of purpose—together, they left me with one undeniable truth: it was time to walk away.

After leaving my job, I took a moment to breathe, to reflect, and to consider what paths might still lie ahead. I didn’t tell my family I had become unemployed; I thought I’d wait until I had something hopeful to share. I hinted to my older siblings that I was planning to set up my own firm, hoping they might support me as I transitioned into practicing my profession. I thought sharing my aspirations might inspire them to rally behind me. But all I received were empty assurances—well-meaning, perhaps, but ultimately hollow.

For two long years, I searched for other opportunities. Desperate to find work, I even considered changing careers. I sent out countless applications to every job I felt qualified for, both locally and abroad, clinging to hope even as my savings dwindled and my reliance on credit grew heavier. The signs of wear began to show. My hairline receded. Wrinkles deepened. Anxiety became harder to hide. All the while, I continued supporting my family, unwilling to let them see how close I was to falling apart.

Then one day, even hope slipped away. I stopped applying. I stopped believing. I began to question everything. Was I too old to start over? Were my expectations too high? Had the world moved on without me? Or had I simply never been good enough?

Eventually, the last thread gave way. My savings were depleted. My credit lines maxed out. The reputation I had built for financial reliability—always paying bills on time, never defaulting—crumbled. Only then, when I could no longer provide, did my older siblings begin to step in.

But I can’t help feeling bitter. Or ashamed, even. I wonder if they only helped because they had no other choice. Maybe they waited until I had burned through every last resource before offering their own. Maybe their help came not out of concern, but out of necessity.

As I began defaulting on my obligations, the stress took a deeper toll. Sleepless nights turned into panic attacks. Calls from banks and collectors became relentless, their threats of legal action growing more aggressive each week. I started selling my belongings just to meet basic needs—and to contribute, even in small ways. I stayed indoors as much as possible, afraid that even a minor accident or illness could push me over the edge.

A year passed. I was drained—emotionally, mentally, and materially. With nothing left to give, I became dependent on the very people I once carried. And with that dependence came a painful estrangement. Every interaction felt awkward, as if I no longer belonged in my own home. I felt useless. Unwanted. An outcast. I had never felt so utterly alone.

And yet, through it all, I never turned to vices. I never took up smoking, drinking, gambling, or drugs. Though the temptation to numb the pain was strong at times, I held on to the belief that surrendering to those things would only deepen my suffering. In a world that had stripped me of so much, I wanted to endure with a clear mind.

Today, the pressure from creditors has eased a little. But another weight remains: the uncertainty of our family’s relocation. Soon, we’ll leave the flat we’ve rented for years and move to a new house. And still, I find myself at a crossroads—not because I am unsure, but because I’ve finally accepted a painful truth.

After everything I’ve endured—years of silent sacrifice, emotional trauma, unspoken resentment, and the ache of being overlooked—I’ve realized I no longer wish to remain tethered to this arrangement. I hold nothing but love and gratitude for the people I once helped carry. But I know now, with deep certainty, that staying will only continue to wound what little of me remains.

I want to start over. I want to reclaim what’s left of my dignity and rebuild a life I can call my own. If I had a steady job—just enough to support myself, pay for housing and utilities, and meet basic needs—I would leave without hesitation. Not out of spite, but out of hope. Hope that I might finally live for myself. I believe I can do more, grow more, and give more if I’m no longer held back by the patterns that broke me.

I know independence won’t come easy. But neither has staying. And right now, nothing frightens me more than being stuck in a place that no longer feels like home.

So I hold on to one simple hope: that somewhere, somehow, a door might open. Not for rescue, but for renewal. With a clean slate, I want to return to the world—not merely to survive, but to contribute, to be useful, to rediscover my purpose, and to pursue the things that once gave me life.","Anxiety"
"1750715135","Too Much To Decipher","Mostly thinking aloud but also open to tips/tricks/advice. I'm a 29 year old female, only med right now is Adderall for ADHD; diagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder 11 years ago.   

My old therapist once told me that my body will tell me I'm anxious before my brain will. Ever since late last night, I've felt nauseous and shaky, and I can tell it's more than likely due to anxiety. But I have so many things going on that could be triggering it, I'm not sure how to overcome/calm myself or what to do.   

One thing could be that yesterday my husband and I drove home from a weekend visit to my parents' house and had a hard conversation on the way home. We are all good and it was by no means a fight, but scenarios we discussed to prevent a fight in the future. There wasn't really a resolution involved but there really couldn't be given we were speaking in anticipation, not reaction.  

Another thing could be that when we did get home, I got a bill from the company we have our solar panels loan through. Apparently our ""promotional period"" ended which I didn't know was happening and now our monthly payment is supposed to be $200 more than it was before, which we absolutely cannot afford right now. It's partly due to a mistake on my part and I feel awful. I've reached out to the company to see if we can make an agreement to a more affordable (but still higher than what we used to pay) for the next year until circumstances change (a debt will be paid off finally) and we can afford that payment but am waiting to hear back.  

Yet another circumstance is that we leave for vacation\* on Monday, which has me worried, too. I always get a little bit of a general anxiety before we leave on a trip. My mind doesn't spiral as much anymore but if I had to put words to why I get that feeling I would say it's things like worrying about drowning at the beach/my son drowning or getting hurt at the beach, car accidents, our dog running away (he's coming with us, but if he were staying at a kennel or with a friend, I'd just be anxious about that too), and more. \*Also, please be kind. I know I just put about how we can't afford an extra $200 a month bill, yet we are going on vacation, but we have had this booked and been setting aside money from side-hustles (AKA, not guaranteed income) for months on end for this AND my father-in-law is coming and helping with costs too.   

In addition, I present at a conference on Thursday. I can't decide if I'm more nervous to present to a really small group because no one wanted to choose my session or just to present in general. This is my first time presenting to teachers who may not work for my school. I also had a hard time at school this year and am switching grades/schools in the fall because my old school/principals always made me feel incapable and stifled any creativity or leadership I tried to show, so I guess I feel like I really have to prove myself at this conference.   

I've tried to distract myself via multiple of my usually helpful means such as reading, writing, cleaning/checking things off my to-do list, etc. but nothing is making this feeling go away or abate at all. ","Anxiety"

"1750718506","Propranolol and Lexapro","Hey guys been dealing with a lot of physical anxiety when im nervous like shaking, rapid pounding heart rate, lump in throat feeling, and just worrying a lot. After seeing all the propranolol reviews I knew I had to try it and my pscyhiatrist gave me 10 mg. Took it for about 2 weeks and I would say yes, my heart rate decreased and I felt a little calmer but it was not all that, that everyone made it out to be like a miracle pill atleast in my experience. At one point I even took 2 in one day of the 10 mg and didn't feel that much of a difference. Told my psychiatrist I didn't really feel it as much hoping she would up the dose but instead she recommended escitalopram oxalate 5mg which I think is lexapro. I never wanted to take SSRI's because of all the negative experiences and because I never thought of my mental anxiety as overwhelming enough for me to take medications for the mental aspect. Not sure what to do and if I should try just taking propranolol 10mg 2 times at once and if the lexapro will even help with the physical aspects. For reference btw because obviously it's important im 98 lb and like 5'6 so not by any means huge enough to take so much propranolol. also my blood pressure most of the time after I take the propranolol is like 98/58 so not the highest either.

I'm not sure if I'm in the right forum.

Sometimes i get these mild anxiety or panic attacks. I just had one, i had just laid down in bed and was scrolling through Reddit.

"1750717847","how learning emotional intelligence helped me manage anxiety in relationships.","Hi everyone, I wanted to share something that’s really helped me with the anxiety I often felt around relationships.

For a long time, I would get caught in cycles of overthinking, fear of abandonment, and feeling desperate for reassurance — especially with partners who weren’t fully present or emotionally available. It created this constant emotional rollercoaster that fed my anxiety and made it harder to feel secure, even when things were calm.

What helped me most was learning about emotional intelligence — not just recognizing my feelings, but understanding why I felt that way, and how my past shaped those reactions. It’s taught me how to set boundaries kindly but firmly, communicate what I need without fear, and most importantly, how to stop confusing chaos and drama with love.

I wrote about this process in a chapter of my ebook, which dives into breaking toxic patterns and building emotional safety with yourself and others. It’s been a game changer in calming my anxious mind and creating healthier connections.

i just can't solve the root of my problem and this year especially i have struggled with anxiety and depression to the point where i get these extremely negative thoughts about myself and the feeling is so intense that i am scared that one day i will act on these thoughts and kill myself.. 
i have chronically low self-esteem and rely waaayyy too much on other people's opinions, and whatever i try to do it just doesn't help
i think that i am extremely incompetent, constantly compare myself to everyone else, i struggle with my sense of identity and my ambitions because i have no idea what i really want to do with my life cause i depend on other's perception of my life, i have very bad driving anxiety and i haven't driven a car in 4 year which makes me think of myself as even more dumb, and the symptoms of anxiety that i get make it super difficult for me to function (especially combined with the countless self-hating ruminations) 
i am very scared of doing anything new in fear of looking stupid in front of others and i think that i have lost all hope for myself
i want to completely isolate myself from friends and the hurt that i cause myself mentally is even starting to feel good?

So a bit of a back story - I don’t have insomnia I have anxiety when it comes to sleep.

My worry is that I will be so anxious that I won’t sleep for days on end (it has never happened) and I feel ridiculous because I have not gone more than 20 hours without sleep. 

About a year ago my doctor prescribed me zopiclone that I take sometimes to help me fall asleep. 

Last night I woke up at 3:30AM now I’m worried about being up for 20 hours if I’m still awake by 11:30pm and that the anxiety will cause me to be awake an additional amount of hours. 

Can anyone re assure me that this anxiety won’t harm me? And that eventually I will always fall asleep no matter the anxiety?","Anxiety"
"1750692407","30 years old. Battling Anxiety. No idea what to do with my life.","I have had some of the worst anxiety of my life in recent months, and also a lot of life changes that have made me realize I am not where I want or need to be with my mental health. I have always considered the possibility that I suffer from anxiety, maybe even depression, but never did much to improve because I would usually always pull myself out of it. But lately it has been hard. And I don’t know what to do. 

I feel like I am in a rut and wanting to do something else, I have been a supervisor in my position for years but I do not feel like there’s much more room for growth in my field, and everything I’d like to do for a living (audio engineering, video editing/production, music, etc.) just seems so unrealistic to me and out of reach, especially in my area. I wouldn’t even know where to start, and those would seem better suited as a hobby at this point. I haven’t even began learning how to do things I’ve wanted for years(since high school) because of this. I have just been coasting at the job I currently have and feel like it has negatively affected me.

While it hasn’t all been bad, have also recently purchased a home with my girlfriend, which I am very grateful for and feel fortunate to have. But even then, I have done nothing but worry about home repairs and potential issues coming up. It’s an older house, we’ve already had to fix things, and I haven’t gone a day without worrying since buying it, I know panic and buyers remorse are normal but it is taking a toll. 

There is a job listed that I have until Friday to apply for, I am considering it, but it is a different field than what I’m in now. I’d be moving from doing security for an office, to a mail clerk/office assistant job. It is a step up in pay and has better benefits, but it is a different office environment, and I am just really scared that if I did happen to get it, I’ll have trouble learning to adapt, losing the job, and then the house. I’m in such a secure place right now at work it’s making it hard to justify, even though I know I need to start having more upward trajectory and learn new skills. It has just made me feel like I’m stuck at my job. 

In between then and now I contracted covid as well, which is what I was thinking what may have caused the extreme anxiety and mood swings in the first place, but after over a month I just can’t seem to shake it. I just feel trapped and helpless, despite having things generally going well at the same time. It doesn’t feel right to have such positive changes in my life, better living conditions, owning a house, great relationship with someone I genuinely love and want to be with for the rest of my life, and also be at such a low point mentally and emotionally. I keep trying to tell myself that I’ll pull myself out. It’ll get better and easier, but it hasn’t. I feel like I should just be doing more.","Anxiety"
"1750640818","Let’s normalise how severe health anxiety can really be!","Hello everyone! I (F 22) have been experiencing probably the most extreme health anxiety I have ever had these past few months and thought I would share my experiences to hopefully provide comfort to anyone going through the same thing to let you know that you are not alone no matter how terrifying and real this all feels <3 

For context I have been living with anxiety for my whole life. I always remember being a child at school and would often have to sprint out of the classroom most weeks as I thought I was suddenly going to throw up. I remember the teacher would always shout at me and I felt so scared and confused about why my body was like this - little did I know this was just the start of my battle with anxiety. About three months ago I fainted when I was out shopping with friends, followed by sweating, shaking and nausea - I had never fainted before so this felt very serious and VERY REAL, I thought I had some incurable cancer or brain tumour but my friends managed to calm me down and distract me for the rest of the day . I went to a&e the next day as the dizziness continued and I was convinced something was terribly wrong. As the nurse checked me over I fainted again in the hospital - I thought this was truly the end. The doctors seemed concerned over my heart rate - I think it was around 160bpm and they gave me IV fluids and lots of blood tests and then a scan of my heart - all came back normal and I was sent away - it was anxiety they said. I didn’t believe them though.

The dizziness continued constantly for every day. Then I developed breathing problems - it felt I was suffocating, like I couldn’t take a full breath, like a big elastic band was constantly squeezing my lungs. I looked in the mirror and swear my lips had a blue tinge. By this point the dizziness had already made me avoid going out of the house so I would just lay in my bed gasping for breath, waiting for my brother to come home from work so he could find me unconscious in my bed and call an ambulance. I thought I was dying of lung cancer or heart disease. 

This suffocating feeling slowly became less frequent and I kind of forgot about it. Then I developed stomach pain and back pain and severe nausea that would just hit me out of nowhere and have me hunched over the toilet for hours - yet I never actually threw up. I googled my symptoms. Lower back pain and stomach pain meant I had ovarian cancer now. One of the symptoms I read about was needing to pee more. Now suddenly I had to pee every half an hour. I went back to my parents house so they could look after me. I ended up having multiple panic attacks over my symptoms and practically screamed at them to take me to a&e as I knew I was dying - the pain was so severe. I went to a&e, more blood tests and they said I was perfectly healthy. 

The week after I had upper back pain and diarrhoea. I googled my symptoms and thought I had a kidney infection and was convinced I was on the verge of going into sepsis. Back to a&e again - I was fine.  After this I began to experience depersonalisation and derealisation constantly. It just came out of nowhere and suddenly nothing felt real, part of me thought I  had actually died in hospital that night when I fainted and I had been a ghost ever since - everything felt so distant and hazy. All I could do was curl up and cry. It was truly the most lonely and terrifying thing I have ever felt and I knew there was something wrong with my brain. A few nights later I had chest pain, palpitations, shoulder pain, and left arm pain. Now I knew I was having a heart attack. I read on Reddit how a guy said he felt so dissociated and unreal before his heart attack hit him I knew I was going through the same thing. My parents refused to take me to a&e this time and I cried and screamed at them like a monster. I didn’t sleep the whole night as I thought I would die in my sleep if I did. But I got up the next and the pain was gone and I was okay. 

The next day I woke up from a nap with a mild headache and suddenly felt like I was going to throw up. I was having a brain aneurysm. I ran to the bathroom and checked the size of my pupils, I SWEAR one was bigger than the other. I refused to sleep that night despite how exhausted I was because I thought again that I would die in my sleep. 

This is some of what I’ve been through in just a few months. My days are filled with isolation, constant body checking, googling - I’m talking all day on my phone googling symptoms and illnesses. Taking my blood pressure and temperature every few minutes, refusing to sleep from fear of dying in my sleep and daily panic attacks triggered by my symptoms.  Although I have no real resolution for this, I feel like recently I have began to at least play with the idea that everything I feel could all be in my head. Going from a heart attack to a brain aneurysm days apart is pretty crazy. Hopefully this can make some other people feel less alone as well and I just want you to know that I feel your pain, your fear, loneliness you are not alone. Sending love everyone <3","Anxiety"

Everytime I think of my privacy being invaded specifically in this case I have suicidal and homicidal thoughts cuz I've never had to share a room before. I'm practically an only child cuz my siblings are at least a decade older than me and ive never lived in the same room as someone ive only had one sleepover (which went terribly) slept in hotels/vacation areas like a cruise I went on slept next to my parents cuz I was a scared little boy and my friend had to beg me to visit his house and I always dreaded it. My privacy is the center of my comfort zone and when its invaded for long periods of time in my own room I panic cuz thats pretty much all I got. I can eat drink sleep game watch tv scroll my phone jork it rage talk to myself and more comfortably in my privacy. If I have to share a room then I cant do any of that comfortably knowing that someone can see me. 

Anyways I keep getting emails from housing about selecting a move-in appointment and I just have to tell them ""not happening unless I get a single occ"" (obviously more professional than that but you get the point). The last thing i need to do for the accommodation is to give them documentation of disability (_____ has X Y Z and its very difficult to deal with) which I will do tomorrow during orientation and then wait I think a week for the final decision. Also I'll mention (most) of this to my therapist wednesday (only seen him twice and I'm scared he'd break confidentiality if I said im gonna kms if I have to share a room)

"1750677637","Sleep anxiety keeps debilitating me","Second night that I can't sleep. I managed to sleep a few hours in the morning yesterday but that's it. Like..... what am I supposed to do with this dang sleep anxiety. And the fact that the melatonin I use, my usual alternative at the moment, is starting to falter now is scaring me cause like.... what am I gonna do the next night?? 

I get super anxious and performance anxiety when I try to sleep sometimes, my heart races and I can feel it the whole night, my head's too loud with mindless chatter, my body starts to run hot and uncomfortable, I get restless/anxious when it takes too long and I can't manage to fall asleep. I'm so tired of dealing with this every few weeks, and then having it get a little worse and worse with my anchor (the melatonin) starting to fail me and not giving me the same strength as before. 

Even more annoying, my relatives look at the whole thing with indifference cause a period of insomnia is something everyone goes through. 

Sure but.... most people manage to sleep something throughout the night when dealing with insomnia, at least 3 hours. I wouldn't be so freaked out then. In my case, I just can't sleep (maybe only half sleep since I keep my eyes shut the whole night) and with *any* luck, I sleep in the morning. 

I'm probably not all that special, no. But every time it happens to me, it feels like I'm the only one going through specific stuff. It feels like no one around me understands the concept of sleep anxiety. 

I hate sleeping, I really do. Genuinely wish it wasn't a necessity and I dread nighttime every time my insomnia has kicked in. By the time 3-4pm comes, I can feel that dread. And time goes too fast for me, it goes way too fast and I'm constantly checking. 

A lot of the times, I'll have decent sleep for a few weeks and it's fine, then the anxiety kicks in one night, maybe when I don't do my usual strict ritual of sleeping (which is probably not healthy in itself but), and it ruins any hope of sleeping and I'm all messed up for a few days. With a borderline mental health crisis of anxiety and depression (from lack of sleep), cause I'm terrified of not sleeping, but then the anxiety of not sleeping keeps me awake, among the other symptoms. It's a nasty, vicious cycle. 

I read online that once you stop caring so much about sleeping/not sleeping, sleep comes easier. But it's really hard to have that mindset when it feels like you're risking something. 

Tired. Would like some reassurance please. Anything to make me feel calmer about the whole thing. ","Anxiety"
"1750709012","Weird symptoms and bad anxiety","So I've been having a very hard time. I have so many weird things going on with me and it's making my health anxiety go crazy! First thing is bad sinus issues! Facial pain and post nasal drip. Hoarse voice at times. Second is my Dr said I have kerritosis pilaris rubra, it's really bad on my right arm and thigh. For two years now my right arm stays red but if I get hot or anxious it gets very red and warm. It freaks me out! It's my whole arm even my hand and fingers get red. Third, I sprained my ankle about 3 months ago, I have sprained my ankles many times growing up. But this time it was different, it did hurt and I heard a Crack or snap noise when it happened. But it didn't swell up bad at all or bruise. Only a little puffy around my ankle bone. Well 3 weeks later I went to work and my foot felt weird! Tingling and stinging. I looked and my foot from the middle of the top down my toes was bright red swollen and hot! I freaked out! Dr did xray and ultrasound and also had me tested for PAD! Peripheral artery disease. Everything turned out normal. My blood work was good also. The swelling and redness only lasted about a hour, after I put my foot up and cooled off it was fine! We'll its been about a month and today it happened again! Idk what's going on! It's freaking me out. And forth, I'm having spotting after sex and after straining, I have ibs-c. Now I do have a cervical polyp so not sure if that can cause it. But all of these things are driving me crazy! I feel like something bad is wrong! Like cancer or lupus or ms! I also have bad facial flushing and my face gets really red and hot. I have spasms in my legs, arms, and stomach allot. I kno anxiety can cause allot of symptoms and weird feelings but not all of my problems can be anxiety. I kno for a fact it don't cause redness and swelling. Idk I just can't take much more! I have a few swollen lymph nodes in my neck that have been that way for over a year now! They haven't gotten bigger or anything but still can't be normal. I just want a Dr to tell me I'm ok and they did all the tests they could and everything is fine! But it takes time to get in and see a Dr then have tests scheduled and then more tests. It's just very overwhelming! Sorry for the long post I needed to vent. I've had allot of tests already and nothing showed up.

"1750694965","Anyone else ever experience feeling like nausea but in your chest during anxiety/panic attacks?","I’m looking to feel less crazy/stupid in how I describe this or just to feel less alone in it. For many years, my panic attacks and anxiety spikes always include this sensation in my chest I can never really describe well- it’s painless, not really pressure and not really tingling or burning, it’s almost like I feel nauseous but in my chest instead of my stomach. My doctors have always said that this is likely palpitations (harmless- I have had a few instances of benign PACs but heart is totally healthy despite my cardiac anxiety). 

Can anyone relate and/or describe this better or is this just me? I feel ridiculous describing something that terrifies me whenever it happens and yet feels like such a vague description that it can’t sound important or make sense to anyone. 

PS just FYI, my symptoms are always the same- this feeling plus I get hot, feel short of breath until I calm my hyperventilation, often have one restroom trip for sudden diarrhea/loose stool, feel like I need to leave wherever I am, oh yes and of course sheer terror and certainty I’m about to die. Sometimes my heart rate rises as high as 120 and no spikes as high as 150/100 (both usually totally normal) but other times those stay in the normal range. Klonopin ALWAYS resolves everything within 30-60 minutes and then symptoms don’t ever return while it’s still active. I have these episodes sometimes not at all for months, sometimes for a few weeks I’ll have one multiple days a week for 1-2 weeks. ","Anxiety"

"1750694652","Can chronically health anxiety cause bowel issues??","For the best part of 2/3 years now I’ve been suffering with a lot of bowel issues,pains cramps gas, urgency and loose stool, undigested food mucus and more it’s  fluctuates daily and I can’t identify any triggers, I’m 21 female.

However I do have extreme health anxiety mainly about my stomach (but about other things like arm pain I’ll convince myself is a heart attack every time and the list goes on) but the stomach anxiety is getting crazy! As soon as I wake up I scan my body for symptoms and almost every time I go straight to the toilet not even 10 mins after waking up.

I’ve been back and forth to the docs and had test. Last year I had bloods and fit test all normal. This year I’ve had another fit test, abdominal ultrasound again normal. My calprotecin has come back slightly raised at 110, so obviously worrying me! My doc is not overly worried and has just suggested a repeat in 2 weeks after I come back off holiday, and given me SimAlvia Tablets to try.

I cannot shake the fear something is seriously wrong like cancer. Even despite the negative fit test and my doctors (seen many) not being worried. I suppose I’m just wondering I’m me being so worried and stressing about my health and being worried I have a serious bowel issue is actually the cause of it all. I’m due to fly to Gran Canaria tmro but all I can think about is my health. And today has been a bad day with my bowels so not helping at all.

I definitely think I may have abit of  ocd intertwined in all this too because I have to do stupid little rituals most of the day and mainly at night, that my brain tells me I need to do or I’m not healthy. I can’t look at colours red or black either bc they= bad and honestly that’s so dangerous while driving lol.

I’d love abit of advice or similar stories please.

The doctors have previously said that anxiety medication should be used as a very last resort which is understandable and this was about over a year ago. Maybe two. And I have suffered with anxiety my whole life. However every time recently my mom has asked any form of doctor about it they have denied the request. I do have an appointment coming up so I will discuss it with them but I need outsider takes on this. 

My anxiety is now affecting my life to the point where i can’t be out of the house for no longer than an hour because i will break down in a panic attack. I will panic. Struggle to breathe. Cry. All the sort. I will panic around lots of people so I can’t be in crowded areas- which is not helpful since I’m about to start sixth form this year. My sleeping medication isn’t working no more. I have tried upping the dose. Lowering it. Nothing is working so I’ve stopped taking it now. My mind is continuously running and I can’t shut it off. At any small convenience I have a panic attack. And it’s not fair. I shouldn’t have to live my life on hard mode anymore. I’ve even went to such lengths I started to self harm. I can’t cope with this anxiety. It feels like I’m having a heart attack at every small inconvenience. I could be laying there literally doing nothing and my mind will race and I can’t stop it. I’ve tried multiple types of therapy and nothing is working. I just don’t know what to do. 

Do you guys think they will give me medication if I tell them all of this. Even my mom doesn’t know enough to the extent I have just shared. But I need help badly and nothing seems to be working at all. ","Anxiety"

About 3 months ago, my father passed away from a glioma, and since that day, I (18M) developed a sharp fear of death and disease. I reached a point where every single pain is interpreted as a tumour or something terrible. For example, when the left area of my chest hurts, I think I'm having a heart attack. When my head hurts, I think I'm having a cerebral tumour. The main problem is that these different fears led me to skip nights of sleep. I keep thinking that if I fall asleep with a small pain, I'm surely gonna die. I can't even plan vacations or anything with my friends and family because I always think I'm dying or I'm going to die soon. I tried to seek help from a therapist, but after many sessions, I'm still deeply impacted and scared, and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.

I just wasted almost 2 hours sitting in my room, all tensed just to stare at my phone and try to force myself to finally press that goddamn dial button with my shaky hands. I tried to calm myself down several times, but the anxiety hit again as soon as I was going to call, before (as the title says) almost having a mental breakdown, just because of a phone call I still have to make. All of this effort for nothing.

I’m experiencing all the symptoms of anxiety — panic, sweating, hot and cold flashes, trembling, nausea, heart palpitations, etc. Normally, I’m a happy person, and usually happy with my life, and I’ve never experienced anything like this before.

It’s been going on for almost two weeks now and it’s not getting any better. I can’t sleep, eat, or go to work.

How is it possible for such intense anxiety to suddenly hit me like this — especially since I’ve never really struggled with anxiety before? I’m scared and don’t understand what’s happening, which is why I’m reaching out here.

I’d really love to hear from you — has anyone experienced anything similar?

"1750704717","My anxiety always ruins my relationships.","I was seeing this guy for a month and he really liked me and things were going really well. He was going to leave on a trip for three weeks on Sunday so I wasn’t going to see him for a while, so the previous week we had plans to hang out a lot. On Thursday, he randomly canceled our plans and didn’t reschedule and wasn’t really texting me back. I started to freak out and texted him a bunch asking when I would see him. He asked me to stop texting him so much and told me he’d get back to me later. But uncertainty of not knowing the next time I’d see him and not knowing where we stood made me so anxious I couldn’t eat for several days, I wasn’t sleeping well, and the physical symptoms like the pit in my stomach and the weight on my chest made it impossible for me to even get out of bed and do literally anything else. Turns out, he was going through something and was also busy with a wedding. Despite knowing these things, I did not leave him alone. So from Thursday to Sunday I texted constantly asking to call or to see him just to try to figure out what was going on. Finally, he sent me a message saying the way I was acting was unacceptable and ridiculous and we should end things. 
He was right. But the thing is, my anxiety was so bad and the only thing that made it slightly better was trying to get a response from him, and I was so desperate to stop feeling that anxious that I was willing to do absolutely anything including bombarding him with texts when I knew he was busy/not in a good headspace. I was not capable of handling my anxiety any other way. 
This always happens. I always get anxious to the point where I can’t control it and end up ruining everything. It doesn’t matter who the person is, how long I’ve been seeing them, or anything else about the situation. The second I feel like I don’t know where we stand or the second I’m asked to give space I get so anxious that it affects my physical health. 
I already know I need to go to therapy and stay away from relationships until I get this handled. 
I guess I’m asking for any general advice for when anxiety is that bad? I try to distract myself but the physical symptoms are so bad that they serve as a reminder of the anxiety so distraction doesn’t work. Breathing exercises are a hit or miss. 
Please, any advice is helpful.  ","Anxiety"

It was a band I knew some songs of but i really liked thier music and considered myself a fan.
And the evening started fine but I didn't want to push my opinions on a subject people talked about , also I didn't know where to walk, my friend was talking to someone and I didn't want to walk next to the girls since I didn't know them and thought that would make them uncomfortable.

When the show started i realised i know like 4 songs and was embarrassed i even went because they all knew them. The concert was 10/10 and I really enjoyed it but couldn't stop thinking how I don't belong near them and when it was over I just went out because I thought they to will but they stayed and managed to get a picture with the artists and I absolutely hate I wasn't in there.

Even worse they created a group to put the pictures in and invited me and it's like salt to a wound. More so because i really liked one of the girls but I just don't feel like I even deserve to be a tought of thiers.

"1750685847","Globus Sensation/Throat tightness adventures","I'm just gonna make a post to vent a bit and see if anyone can relate.


I've fallen back into the rabbit hole of health anxiety. For the most part and past 6 months, it's been focused on throat feeling tight or closing/getting obstructed. 


It used to be mostly a tight feeling constantly, but I've had some good periods on and off. 
What consistently seems to set it off is movement? Taking a walk longer than 10 minutes, sitting on a bus or driving a car with vibrations. It's like the neck/throat starts feeling tight or closing, or as if something gets ""dislodged"" and starts blocking things.



Except nothings really blocked and I can breathe and swallow as normal, it just feels as if something is tightening and its rougher to speak and brain starts shouting ""danger""


When it happens on a long bus ride or otherwise, I can usually distract myself with some high focus requiring games or similar on phone and most of the discomfort seems to go away.


I probably also have rather tense neck muscles from bad posture or subconsciously tightening shoulders I guess, and wonder if it's worth looking into some form of physical therapy or similar things for it.

I realize this post is a bit of a mess since I'm a bit of a mess myself while writing. I don't really expect any replies, but I guess I just wanted to write it down anyway.

 To summarize what I've learned about it and what helps:

Triggers it: 
- Walking outside, car or bus rides, possibly being in an unfamiliar enviroment where I don't have access to my normal distractions or aid. 
- Some drinks or foods that make throat feel ""clogged"" with air bubbles like soda.
- Probably any kind of soreness or normal discomfort that brings focus to the throat, such as straining my voice

Helps:
-Sitting down/relaxing with laptop, playing games that takes high amount of concentration or focus
-Sipping warm drinks, tea mostly
-Laying down, raised feet, calm breathing exercises. (Sometimes)
-The good old reassurement from doctors or professionals that is doesn't sound like anything but anxiety


I'm wondering if anyone has any experience or insights regarding this. Either throat tightness in general or specifically those kind of things happening when being active like walking or being in an unfamiliar environment. 
I'm specifically kind of annoyed and curious why it seems to happen specifically with activity or just walking outside. I'm aware it's probably a bad loop of anxiety and negative reinforcement since it has happened before, but it's still just...weird to me that it almost always happens like clockwork after a certain amount of time walking outside.","Anxiety"

I’m used to anxiety and panicking mostly which started when i was 16 and that’s been about the most i’ve experienced and i know the impending doom and everything that usually comes with it. About 2 months ago i started panicking really bad in my last relationship when i couldn’t even be around my ex without panicking to the point of feeling like i was gonna pass out, seize or something, having to pour cold water on my neck, insane shaking, and feeling like something is severely wrong with me. after her and i broke up that stopped for the most part. 

But about 3 weeks ago i was at work and suddenly out of nowhere i felt it the worst i ever had. I felt like i was gonna faint, I was nauseous, dizzy, my vision went fully into a kaleidoscope my left ear was ringing, my chest had pressure, and i felt extremely weak like i also had to poop or something. I went to the hospital a bit later and they did an ekg, chest xray, and blood work and found nothing wrong other than that maybe i ate gluten in my gluten allergy but they couldn’t tell me that. 

That one time did pass but ever since that I haven’t felt normal for a single day to the point where i’m on medical leave from work for the next month because of it. I wake up with chest pressure, I can’t eat anything without feeling sick a few minutes later, my left arm has just started to develop this thing where it feels crazy tightness while i have to burp constantly and my chest hurts with consistent tightness, my vision will never focus, my legs feel weak throughout the day pretty consistently, and my left ear literally rings and hurts all the time. 

I went to the hospital in an ambulance a week later as i felt all these symptoms like i was gonna pass out or worse, and they said the same thing after an ekg, xray, and that my blood work said i might’ve worked out a bit too hard recently (which i had the past week) but they still didn’t have an explanation for the other stuff other than anxiety. 

I just went to the doctors for a followup a few days ago and they just did an ekg, did my blood, ordered me a halter monitor because they don’t see anything either. I can’t tell if this is anxiety, 100% real, or if they aren’t seeing anything come up because they’re doing the wrong tests and idk why they aren’t checking me more with how bad it is. It’s becoming so draining. I feel like i’m gonna pass out randomly, and this arm thing that just started is stressing me out so much more because it feels so tight and like it’s not under my control as much. I also have this weird thing where i feel cold all over the arm randomly and my neck keeps getting randomly tight during these moments too. 

I just wanna be definitively told there’s nothing wrong with me and it’s really frustrating because i feel so horrible 24/7 yet im constantly told there’s nothing wrong with no satisfying solution or answer other than anxiety when i feel so miserable.

"1750697226","Whats the best way for me to calm down or not feel paranoid?","This is my third time posting so sorry if im posting too much, but its been 7 days since ive been feeling paranoid and depressed. Whenevr i take some supplements like serenita, 5-htp and ashwagandha i feel a little bit calm and i dont feel that much of my chest tightness but feel horribly depressed. Last night  while driving home i started thinking of some horror and even though i tried to stop thinking of it i felt horrible and paranoid with cold sweat so after i came home i just took  some supplements trying a way for me to calm down and thid morning i felt the same. 

Ever since the first day i watched some horror stuff on youtube ive just felt paranoid or just depressed for no reason like if i had some shock and now im trying to adjust but i cant. Even with my family support and gf i still feel hopeless and anxious the more i think of it. Im taking the supplements i mentioned and some other more but theyre the same and i worry im taking too much of them which might make what im feeling worse.

For the moments the only things im trying is just taking those supplements but i fear im taking a lot of them and just trying to go out to clear mind out. Ive been using chatgpt but i think i should stop cause it might just worry me more if i keep searching whatever is wrong with me. Even when im with my family i keep feeling like thisband even any basic activities i do just feel draining. I also searche for a psicologist which is in teo days  and a psychiatrist but its gonna be two months before i see him. So is there anything else i can do to just help me relax?","Anxiety"
"1750696731","Anyone have tips on coping with sleep anxiety?","I’ve been coping with anxiety for most of my life and I’ve found in the past several years it’s started to impact my sleep and it’ll get to the point where I start becoming anxious about being able to fall asleep, and a few years ago I started going down a dark rabbit hole where I was starting to convince myself that I was never going to be able to sleep again.

It’s hard to explain, but I’ll be tossing and turning in bed and my thoughts will be racing and I’ll start to feel warm and sweaty and I’ll get this overwhelming sense of doom that hits me hard in the chest and it makes it very difficult for me to fall asleep right away. Eventually I’ll just tire myself out and I’ll fall asleep but I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if they have any tips on how to cope with it.

I’m also on medication that helps with sleep (an antidepressant and an antipsychotic) that I take right before bed and they definitely help with making me groggy but sometimes the anxiety will outweigh the effects for a little bit.

In the past, when I start feeling anxious I’ll always remind myself that it never lasts forever and it always gets better but sometimes if my anxiety gets bad enough I find that doesn’t really help. I don’t want to keep upping my medications so I’m hoping to find some more ways to train my brain to deal with this anxiety better. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!","Anxiety"

For the last three years my body goes suddenly in a situation of panic ( I want to breath more air , heartbeat increase, dry throat) at first I didn't know what was that thought it's related to my digestive system but then I knew it's anxiety attack. 


I went to a therapist and got better with breath exercise and that 

But lately this month I got two one in first week and the other yesterday and both of them I was alone 

There are reasons, we lost my work colleague in accident, my sister got sick with something in her eyes , me got sick in my left shoulder but I did blood test CBC and vitamin d I'm as usual anemic 

Yesterday I talked to a psychiatrist for the first time asked me to do this tsh, t3 ,t4 to make sure it's not physical health, I will do that because I really need to be better 

Only that my family doesn't support me and they think all my life issues related to me not eating since I'm skinny and it makes me mad. 

I love them but their way of thinking as if it's easy and I'm overreacting makes me so sad. I really wish I just want help 

Also I'm working from home and most of my besties are married that's why I don't go out a lot , I was planning on changing that but what happened yesterday made me depressed and unmotivated

"1750695587","Worried about being judged for preferring to make female friends as straight man","I’m a 22 year old man. I currently have little interest in dating or relationships or anything that comes with them.

At this moment I don’t have very many friends. Most of the time in social situations (work, university, meet-ups with people etc), I actually enjoy socialising with women much more than men (and yes, I feel embarrassed about this). Honestly, I find socialising with women more enjoyable. I actually wish I have more courage to pursue friendships with people as opposed to just chatting to people. I’m anxious of the fact that if I’m caught making friends with some women then people are either judging me as gay or a womaniser - none of these are true. I’m worried what my parents are thinking (I still live with them). I’m worried about what other men are thinking about me - whether that be being suspected of being gay or a player. In reality I’m the opposite of a ‘player’ and feel as though I have little interest in sexual relationships (I’m not asexual though).

Because of this (and other unrelated stuff I’ve been worrying about, mostly job security), I just feel deflated due to loneliness some days and I’ve spent hours some days staring at my bedroom wall and not even wanted to get out of bed. I live with my parents still and they keep saying that I look tired, anxious and as if I’m generally hiding something.

I’m too embarrassed to even speak to a therapist or counsellor about this one. ","Anxiety"

I (29M) try so hard to make other peoples lives easier and I've tried even harder to not let it get to a point where I'm essentially self-destructive in order to preserve others. I give money to close friends to help keep their electric on, I offer people free rides, I take on more at work because I know the stress of it all for those under me, I stay up late at night to make sure a friend gets to vent or has an outside opinion to make their lives better. 

But how much longer can I keep this up?

I'm so tired. I feel used. I feel like my efforts go under the radar, but somehow my brain tells me thats okay. There is goodness to be had in staying in the background and watch others rise, but why do I feel like I'm leaving myself at the back of the line in the mud and muck while I set up others? 

I've never been ashamed of my sense of empathy or compassion to others, but the weight is just growing more and more on my shoulders. I try to take steps to do less to let people do things on their own, but then I somehow find myself in the same position: stagnating so others can rise.

"1750681662","Do I have a personality problem or do I have social phobia?","Recently, I was scolded by my friends because I am afraid of socializing.



I am afraid to say hello to people I know or people I am not very familiar with but know. If I see these people from a distance on the street, I will avoid them (sometimes even take a long detour), or not say hello. I will wonder what if I say hello but they don’t say hello, or if I say hello, will they think I am pretending to be familiar with them.



When I was in high school, I didn’t finish an exam, and I needed to go to the teacher during lunch time to continue the exam. Then the teacher gave me the test paper and asked me to go to any class and ask the teacher inside if I could take the exam inside. I walked through many classes, and even many of them only had teachers inside. But I always stood at the door for a while and then left. I didn’t dare to go in and ask. In the end, I found a corridor to take the exam in hiding.



When I pass by others on the street, if they are laughing, I will guess in my mind whether they are laughing at me. Is my outfit funny or something else.



Before attending various events, I will also anticipate various possible scenarios and then get nervous.



When I am afraid, my heart beats very fast, and sometimes I blush very much, and my neck feels very hard and dry. Then I may be speechless for even very simple questions.



Is this just a personality problem or a social barrier? If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask. Pls give me some advise.","Anxiety"
"1750694585","Stopping Buspirone cold turkey","I had a doctors appointment today to discuss my anxiety and depression, I had an appointment six weeks ago after I had been taking 15mg of buspirone a day for 3 months, my doctor upped it to 30 due to some improvement, but not exactly what we were hoping for. My anxiety since upping the meds has been almost unmanageable, constant spiraling, losing sleep, just all around feeling miserable constantly. 

My doctor wanted to switch gears, so they told me to go ahead and quit the buspirone, and they are starting me on 1.5mg of Vaylar tonight. I guess I was just wondering if there’s anyone else who has gone from buspirone to vaylar, and what there experiences were like? What was it like getting off the buspirone, I should also note I take 60mg of duloxetine in the morning everyday as well to pair with the anxiety medication. I honestly am feeling really relieved to stop the buspirone, I’ve heard people say fairly decent things of being on Vaylar to help stabilize their mood and in turn helps them with anxiety.

It's been 4 months and I'm still like this. I don't know if it's DPDR because I don't feel like I'm in a dream. My cognition is just crap, my memory is non existent and I seem like I can't bounce back off this. 

Talk therapy doesn't help and tbh I feel like I ruined my life at this point. I wish I had taken benzos or anything earlier when I started spiralling, I was so anti medication but looking back anxiety took a shot on of the last few years..  
  
I wonder if anyone has been like this and if there are any chances for recovery.

But, why are the autowalas in this city such blatantly dishonest? And mind you, the autowalas here, especially after the bike taxi ban has uped a notch. They are more than just autodrivers now, they've turned into fullblown wannabe gangsters.Under the garb of regional language and a sub-nationalistic sentiment, I find these people trying desparety hard to imitate what there films have long portrayed as 'Macho' behaviour. Everyone knows what is been talked about here. The whole of India knows by now! 
This is what happens when you glorify sub-nationalistic behaviour to a point where if you identify yourself with an identity that is greater than yours alone and become a part of a group - you become invincible. This group although, perceives of their existence as merely existential - just existing, surviving. But by weaponising this Kannadiga identity, these autowalas have started to intimidate, degrade and coerce working class individuals by trying to extort money, that too, on a daily basis. 
Commuters should avoid this mode of comute. Avail the metro, take buses, walk even!

About 8 weeks ago, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro 10mg, and honestly, it was the worst experience of my life. After starting the 10mg dose, I noticed this growing psychomotor agitation — it was getting worse day by day, along with completely zero libido.

The stress reaction never really went away, the muscle pain stayed the same, I couldn’t sleep, and I felt like I had endless energy. After talking to my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose down to 5mg, but I still feel the same way — and now even the brief moments of joy or mood improvement are gone. I’m constantly wired, can’t sit still, my mind is racing, and I feel sped up all the time.

"1750653368","How can I help my wife?","My wife (34) was prescribed SSRIs about 8 years ago and is not the best at taking them. The last year or so she has been off them, eating healthy, exercising etc. and doing really well. Recently we just moved, kids are out of school, lost a pet and have been really busy. She is very concerned about her weight and has put on about 10 pounds. Still looks phenomenal but she thinks she doesn’t. The kids have been a pain lately (8, 5, 3) and fighting with each other like crazy, not listening and all the other things kids do. 

Well tonight I was in the basement working on a project and she comes down freaking out. Tells me she is going to be sick, crying, can’t catch her breath, saying she feels like she is going to vomit and needs to use the toilet. She couldn’t tell me what was wrong, just kept asking me if she is safe. She proceeds to tell me she is worried that she would snap and hurt herself or the kids and explains that she would never do that but other mothers have and they probably said the same thing. She said she doesn’t have thoughts of hurting herself or anyone else, but kept saying that maybe she was crazy. I was at a complete loss on what to do. I used to be a paramedic and had my fair share of calls with panic and anxiety attacks but I felt at a total loss on how to help her. I kept trying to reassure her and tell her she was safe. This went on for close to an hour and finally got her to relax and start doing some breathing exercises. She also told me that she started taking her meds again 5 days ago and is afraid that’s what triggered this. We have been together 15 years and I have never seen this before with her. I was honestly scared!

if you’re there, god, i’m sorry that humanity has done this

i’m sure it was not your intention when you planted the garden of eden

but if you are there, god, you should know that we aren’t stealing apples anymore

we’re blowing things up,

killing people,

going to war,

destroying our planet

were humans destined to take the authority to play god, 

to create our own laws that result in our own reparations, our own penalties?

the cost of our actions is not one-dimensional, 

meaning it is not defined by the bounds of manmade existence, 

not limited to the confines of our human values, 

and yet, the way we are dealt consequences hurts because of things that have grown with us

dead loved ones, 

burned buildings, 

wounded economy;

these punishments exist solely in our circle of recycled oxygen, of repeated words

fuck you, god, if you gave humanity the right to autonomy, 

because the blood of an aching world is on their hands, our hands

the blood, thick and warm and metallic against the air, isn’t yet finished shedding

and yes, these are bloody fingerprints on the walls of human history, 

scarred trees that mark the generations who have gone through similar trials, 

but struggles of the past do not have to contradict current conflicts

old wounds don’t heal new ones, nor protect them from infection

history can’t invalidate the present

god, i may have asked too much from you

i am not a girl of god by any means, and so what right do i have to start praying now?

i have no right

but, at least, i would like to believe in a world where i have a right to life without war

a right to a guaranteed future

please, god, forbid a war

revoke humanity’s independence

if you’re there, god, intervene;

be the all-knowing, all-present being which you are considered

your little project, your people, are going off the rails

please, god, allow me just a chance to walk a fruitful path

i want to write, to travel, to make friends and fall in love and see this earth which you created

if you are there, god, and you nurtured this planet from the palm of your hand, 

grant me the opportunity to reap what you sowed,

allow me the chance to see the world you fostered instead of the one humanity singed

But recently I've been getting sharp shooting pains in my head. Specifically the back of my head. I've dealt with this a couple months ago, but it went away for while until now. I've also struggled with breathing because when I take deep breaths to calm down, I start becoming aware of my breathing and it's hard for me to take my mind off it.

But today I showed up, haven’t even been there for a hour. And a customer yells at me for their own mistake. They start harassing me and calling me a liar. Basically they said “ I pocket there $2.50” so I said want see proof. Throw everything in my pockets behind the register. And said I’m done. My co worker told me I should leave and I happy did. 
I told my manager that I was being harassed and not in the proper state of mind to continue my shift. 
Then I texted my therapist and they told me “I’m sorry to hear that, but it sounds like you were at your point with that place”
& “Hang in there, it sounds like you’re definitely better off without that job”

"1750668792","Nothing works","I started having really bad anxiety after the Covid pandemic: that was probably the lowest of my life as I literally lived every second with anxiety, I couldn’t leave my house, couldn’t go to school, couldn’t even eat anything out of the ordinary without panic attacks. 

Now, it’s been some years, and even if there might be little improvements, I’m going insane.
Right now i’m on medication (escitalopram, 1.5 pills a day) but I feel like it doesn’t do anything to help: I did see improvements with the depressive part of my disorder, which is better than nothing ig, but no better with the anxiety, which is the main problem. I started getting these pills in february and they did nothing, i had my two biggest panic attacks of this year WHILE i took these pills and i only managed to get through them thanks to another one (temesta) that is only for occasional attacks.

I genuinely do not know what to do anymore: I’ve tried meditating, I’m on medication, I’ve been followed by a therapist for years, what am i missing???

idk maybe it’s related to my physical issues like anemia, but still it’s unbearable and i cannot manage to go on like this anymore, i literally cannot even see my future and i plan everything based on my anxiety, not what i like. i don’t even have hobbies anymore. i don’t have a life. i have friends that i made at school but outside of school i can never see them because i’m too anxious, i can’t enjoy anything anymore and it’s destroying my life. i cannot even eat right because anxiety always gets to my stomach and, as i’m always anxious, i eat only to survive basically.
i need help, advice, anything that can help me because i feel like i’m slowly drowning and there’s no way up.

sorry, just to add: i’m also like super scared because when i started taking meds i vowed to not let them be stronger than my mind, as in like taking temesta only if it was a super serious situation. now i’ve taken it two different times and i feel like i’m already mentally relaying on it way too much","Anxiety"

"1750637893","I had an Insane Panic attack","I'm on day 7 of my 3 day panic attack right now (the worst part lasted 3 days). Last week I was noticing head pain in my left side, we went over the mountain and the pressure got really intense, after dropping back down I felt fine and went about my night.

The next morning I woke up at home feeling very weird, my heart began racing, I couldn't breathe and I started having severe paranoia and felt like everyone was a government spy....please don't laugh cause this is really scary for me.

I went through the night with burning and pain in my chest and feeling like I was going down a rollercoaster. 

I woke up the next day with pulse of 145 so I went to the ER, they found some slight problems with my EKG but nothing crazy, my oxygen levels were low but that's about it. No concerning labs. They sent me away.

I went home, still not feeling well, thoughts racing and genuinely feeling like I have gone nuts.

Today is day 7, I'm feeling better physically than I was but why do I feel out of my body? I can't seem to lock in to anything, I also keep having weird repetitive thoughts. Sometimes I feel better and then I think ""oh I haven't felt weird for a bit""....and I'm right back to feeling weird again.

The thoughts are scary and paranoia related, and my vision is really messed up.

Will I ever feel normal again? Will I ever feel in my body again? Sometimes I start randomly crying too and it's uncontrollable.
When I looked this up on Google it says panic attacks don't generally last 3 days...well mine did. So wtf is going on.

"1750621945","Here to say a few calming words","Hi guys, 

This sub has helped me a lot whenever I have a panic attack or anxiety flare.. So this time I want to help some of you dealing with anxious thoughts.
I saw so many posts about ww3 fear because of the recent escalations. 
The thing is we are chronically online and with cheap internet we kinda now know each and everything happening in the world. And people love to sensationalize any event happening in the world. 
I am no expert in geopolitics but I have noticed the pre-internet era conflicts are not much talked about. 
Israel conflic has been going on for decades now. There was a time when the whole middle East got involved.. A time when Egypt was extremely powerful but that did not trigger a world War. 
Another example is the decade long iran-iraq war that again saw foreign players taking their shot in it but even that wasn't ww. 
India-pakistan? Kargil was one of the biggest wars fought that saw both countries being supported by different nations.. Again not a ww. 
Now coming to another important point.. We now live in a nuclear world where everyone knows that shooting nukeswould be beneficial for no one.. Politicians want power.. They want to rule.. If everyone dies then what's the point? you can't rule a barren land. Also for a war to happen the world needs two sides.. We don't have that.. Everyone is dependent on everyone.. Your enemy is your friend's friend.. And your friend is your enemy's friend... It's tooooo confusing.. you cannot pick sides and lose your strategic economic partnerships..
Now we don't know what the future holds but there is a sort of guarantee that war is beneficial for no one....
I hope this gives a little peace to your mind.. And I pray that good sense prevails in all the countries and we see peace in the world 🤞🤞🧿","Anxiety"

I’m diagnosed with anxiety and medicated and of course as you can all relate im sure, I am super anxious. I just graduated college and my next big step in life is taking up a travel job.

I am already anxious about doing the job without high tensions just since im a home body but thought it was an opportunity I couldn’t refuse. 

This is supposed to be fun, a life long memory, but now I feel like I’m going to die if I get on a plane or step in the airport with reports of sleeper operations and all that.

I’m scared, disappointed, and probably won’t sleep the entire night. Any advice? Words of wisdom? I know airports are now super safe compared to how they were pre 9/11 but I still can’t help but feel horrified riding in a giant metal tube in the sky a couple of times a week that could crash. My one hope of this job being fun and a once in a lifetime experience has switched to it feeling like it’s my only once in a lifetime experience and I will die doing it. Please help!

"1750646346","Is it sleep anxiety? I’m terrified","I do have anxiety but I started wondering if whatever happens to me at night is related to it or if I should start to seriously worry. 

I will start by saying it doesn’t happen everyday. I think it’s the third time in the span of a month.

When I lay down, after some time I have trouble breathing, I can only take short breaths. The left side of my chest starts to hurt a little (heart? lung? I don’t know). My heart is not racing like crazy compared to my regular anxiety. When I eventually get to this phase when I start to doze off, I quickly try to wake myself up because it feels like I’m about to pass out. Then I sit up and automatically can breathe normally. 

Anxiety confuses me so badly. I felt fine the entire day. Not a single negative thought. I laid down and started thinking about Pokemon. Then that. Why, just why do I feel this way seemingly out of nowhere? I started experiencing terrible anxiety at the beginning of the year, was literally terrified to leave home, but my room and my bed were the only places I always felt safe.

My anxiety got a lot better recently (stopped taking meds), that’s why I have this paranoia that there’s something wrong with my heart/lungs/any other body part and I’m about to pass out. Or maybe it’s actually true? I don’t know and it’s making it hard for me. 

I know you guys are not doctors, but is it the same for you? With the pain and breathing problems? I honestly want to cry right now, it’s 4am, didn’t have a single minute of sleep, have to cancel plans with a friend I really wanted to see today","Anxiety"
"1750659134","Heart Health Anxiety","Hi! Recently, I have been feeling very weird, mainly in my heart area. It is very hard to describe but my heart just feels weird. It feels like something heavy in my chest with pressure, if that makes sense. The sensation can last for hours, and sometimes I get up and walk around or take a shower to try and help it a bit. It is worse at night when I know that if I have a heart attack, no one will know until morning because I am sleeping alone in my room. No pain at all in the sensation though. The first time I got this weird sensation I went to urgent care, got an EKG, and they said everything was fine, but it kept happening. 

I decided to quit vaping after vaping for 6-7 months because I assumed thats what caused it. But after a week vape free it is still happening. Went to urgent care again and they said that I am super low risk for heart diseases, despite being overweight, and that I should cut caffeine. They also gave me a prescription for hydroxyzine (an allergy medicine that works for anxiety.) 

The medication doesn't really work, even though I think the issue is that I have bad health anxiety. I take it when I have this sensation but it doesn't really do anything. I have an appointment with my primary doctor in about a month (that was the earliest they could get me in) and am hoping to talk to my doctor about everyday anxiety medication and/or taking tests to see if there is an actual issue. 

While I do wholeheartedly believe this is just anxiety, I still have a sliver of doubt that pops up every time I have this feeling and believe I will have a heart attack. 

Has this happened to anyone else? and if so how did you fix it? Any help/knowledge/tips is appreciated. ","Anxiety"

I’ve never had a job in my life and I am twenty years old. I hate that people automatically assume it’s due to laziness when in reality it feels there’s a huge mental barrier that I’m struggling to overcome.

I want nothing more than to have a job where I feel comfortable in my abilities to just do my tasks and head home, however, every job in my area seems to be very front of house related. For example, waitressing and care home jobs.

Last month, I managed to work up the courage to get an interview at a warehouse as I’ve heard it’s quite anti-social and repetitive work but both of those aspects ironically felt like it suited me as I’m not the best with people and I am a person who prefers predictability and routine.

However, after two interviews and a whole month of back and forth communication, I got rejected. Naturally, this honestly crushed me as I thought I was finally able to get my life together. 

Now I feel like I’m back at square one and my confidence is at an all new low and I still feel anxious about it all as I genuinely feel so useless compared to everyone else my age.

ihave always had anxiety and health anxiety but this month it has reached a whole new level. 2 weeks ago i went to the er with dizziness (not vertigo), imbalance (my body falling while standing if i don’t use my strength), they did some blood tests, cardiograph etc and didn’t find anything. next day i was back at the er cause i also had chest tightness so they also did an echo and a thoracic xray. all came back clear. next week after that i’m in the er again cause i fainted at a lab where i went for some extra blood work (also came back fine) and then vomited and had nape pain. they kept me there for the night cause i had an mri/mra which i was scheduled to do since my ent asked for it. came back clear. the following day i went to my ent again who sent me to do some tests at the audiologist. the tests showed i have unilateral vestibular hypofunction by 21% in my left labyrinth. this helped a lot because i finally got a diagnosis and my ent prescribed me betaserc for this along with ompranyt. the day i went to my ent i also had some weird feeling in my right leg/knee. it’s not a painful feeling it’s more like i feel like my right leg is slightly heavier than my other leg, i figured it’s from basically walking close to nothing these 2 weeks and also since i haven’t been to the gym in over 2 weeks. i started light walking around the house and garden yesterday. while walking i also felt my right arm slightly heavier than my left, i woke up today at around 5am cause my right arm was hurting, specifically my elbow and extending towards my hand. ofc i panicked but i also tried some things to see if it would help (what helped was massaging my right shoulder and traps and kind of bending the arm so that the lower and upper part sits together). i now woke up with stomach pain (which kinda went away after going to the bathroom) but when i wiped (sorry gross ik) the color was like dark green which i read can come from iron supplements (which i took one 2 days ago). the thing is i was thrilled to finally have a diagnosis for what’s going on but now i seem to have something new bothering me almost every day which makes my anxiety spike up and make me think “oh the doctors must have missed something in the mri/mra” this type of stuff. I was also prescribed ametriptyline 10mg once a day, by my gp who i went to before the ent (he also said something about my blood flow to the inner ear through the ultrasound he did). I do want to start it but i’m just scared of any of the side effects especially mixed with everything else i will start taking (definitely will start the meds by tmr). idk i guess i just need some advice or support, thank you if you made it this far.","Anxiety"

"1750627446","Aren’t I too old for this??","Hi everyone, I’ve always been a silent participant on Reddit, but I have a question. I’m 29 and have only ever suffered from the occasional social anxiety, but I feel like once I turned 25, I started becoming so hyper aware of things happening in my body that I convince myself I have all these issues that I don’t actually have. For example, I’ve recently become hyper aware of my heartbeat, which of course makes my heart beat faster and then I’m convinced I’m on the verge of a heart attack. I can also feel that my sports bra band is too tight (it isn’t) which makes me believe I can’t breathe even though I’m fully able to take a deep breath and that also makes my heart beat faster so I guess my question is this: did I develop anxiety at the ripe age of 25 or do I need to see a doctor?? I should also mention that I do see a doctor annually and I’m healthy, however I don’t exercise nearly as much as I used to so that could also be it, but idk lol I feel like if I were to become an anxious person, it would have been while I was growing up (like my best friend who legitimately has anxiety). Was turning 25 and developing a prefrontal cortex the catalyst for this anxiety?? ","Anxiety"

"1750661846","from occasional anxiety to constant overwhelm","i’ve been dealing with anxiety since i was around 12, mostly social anxiety which got pretty bad in high school. i’ve always sort of pushed it down and not taken any steps to cope with it (talking about my issues is super hard and im not sure why. i think im used to living in my head and really scared to disrupt that.)

it sort of got better towards the end of high school, but during my 2nd semester of uni i fell into a major depressive episode which severely heightened my anxiety at the time. i didn’t want to go to class, i would feel on edge every time i was outside, and it was super rough.

i slowly got out of that episode, mostly because other issues took the forefront which i won’t get into. now, recently, i feel myself getting depressed again and my anxiety is so so high. i’ve never felt this on edge all the time, my stomach drops regularly just thinking of normal things, my heart beats fast all the time, and i just feel so unhappy and i don’t know what to do. i’ve never had to deal with my anxiety being this constant and all i can think about is how anxious and unsettled i feel. 

i feel for all the people with anxiety surrounding stuff like health, world issues, etc. i just feel even more lost because mine is not locked onto any specific issue. it’s like i just can’t settle in my own body and it’s so debilitating. thanks for any support or advice:(","Anxiety"

So I cleaned the lint trap (which was pretty dusty) and decided against restarting the dryer since we’ve already figured out blanket plans for the night. The smoke alarm is pretty close to my laundry room. It went off maybe 1 minute after clearing the lint trap. So logically, it was the dust and the humidity from the dryer.

I have bad anxiety and I worry a lot this has been going on the last 4 years. I’ve learned to cope and get thru them. But last night had a very scary experience, I’ve never had an attack like this one EVER! so a few hours after eating, I went to bed and woke up in the middle of the night around 2:30 am with a racing heart. My heart was beating so fast and hard that I could feel and almost see it through my chest. I also had chest pain, cramping in my abdomen and it felt like I was dying. I tried to calm myself with cold water and ice packs, but the feeling wouldn’t stop I couldn’t catch my breath or calm down.

So yea I couldn’t think. My mind went blank. I honestly was just gonna let whatever happen to me happen because I couldn’t get myself calm. I was crying so bad thought I was having a heart attack. I don’t understand why this happened to me and it being that intense as it was! 

But I ended up calling 911. The EMTs arrived, checked my vitals and did an EKG. They said my heart rate was very high at first, but it eventually went back down and they said things looked okay.

I still feel shaken, and I’m scared it might happen again. ","Anxiety"

And for some reason it stops after that in like 5 min. 

Only thing that is annoying is that your body doesn't stop the symptoms immediately so although YOU may be calm as hell and normal your arm might still be tensing up and you gotta look at it like ""come on man, it's chill now what are you doing"" 😂

"1750606468","Vision still feels “off” after panic attack years ago – even with glasses. Anyone else?","Hey everyone,

I’m hoping someone here can relate or share advice. A few years ago, I had a major panic attack that really shook me up. Ever since then, my vision has never felt quite right, even though I’ve had two eye exams and now wear glasses.

Both eye exams went well — I felt like I could see clearly during the tests, and the glasses helped a bit… but not completely. Things still often look slightly blurry or off, even though the prescription should be correct. It’s not like I can’t see, but it’s like my brain isn’t fully “processing” what I see. Almost like there’s a mild haze or detachment from the visual world.

Some details:
	•	This started right after my panic attack, so I really think it’s connected.
	•	My eyes seem physically fine, but something feels wrong with how I’m seeing.
	•	I sometimes feel like I have to “try” to see, especially in busy environments or under stress.
	•	Bright light or overstimulation makes it worse.
	•	It’s not full-on visual snow, but more like fuzzy, unfocused perception, even with glasses.

I’ve seen terms like visual processing issues, visual disconnection, or functional vision problems related to stress/anxiety, but I don’t know what category this falls into.

Has anyone experienced something similar — like your vision feels off after anxiety or trauma, even though your eyes test fine?
And if so, did anything help?

Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through this or found a way to cope/improve.

Thanks 🙏","Anxiety"
"1750655002","Hypothetical Scenario","Imagine you were the reason people around the world were feeling “anxious” and “depressed”. Real depression and anxiety does exist and it isn’t because of you but because of you people feel sensations and feelings that are the same as anxiety and depression. What would you do? You don’t want to cause people to feel that way but you do. You can’t explain to people that you’re the reason why they’re feeling that way because they would think you’re crazy and won’t believe you. Or if they do believe you they would hate you for it. You hate that you are “controlling” people’s emotions. If you feel anxious other people feel more anxious so you try to avoid anything that would make you anxious and stay in bed numbing your emotions and stop thinking. You want to continue with your life just as other people get to but when you try to people start complaining that they feel anxious and depressed and life sucks again. You try not to think about the effect you’re having on people because if you think too much you get scared about how many people you are affecting negatively. Some days you’re able to give people a “good day” by not thinking too much and staying distracted but then you start to get anxious or think too much and then everyone has a “bad day” and complains that they were doing so good but got “back to square one” or want to “delete themselves”. You start to feel bad that no matter how many good days you give the moment you give a bad day all that work becomes meaningless. You think maybe you should stop trying to focus at all on how you’re affecting people and just do what you want and not care if you’re causing people to have “bad days” because you should prioritize yourself. But once you in a while you decide to check what people are saying on forums. You start to feel a bit mad at everyone because you know they don’t actually have “anxiety” or “depression” but you are making them feel ways in which makes them think they do. You feel mad because they are so anxious/depressed and you wish they would stop feeling that way. You feel mad because you know everyone in the world is feeling the way they are but they are able to get along fine with life but these people can’t/won’t. ","Anxiety"
"1750641134","My Anxiety Story","from as far as I can remember I have always had anxiety. When I was younger, it was triggered by large crowds, loud music and a lot of overstimulation (which I still deal with sometimes now). I would go into complete panic when being put in these situations, I would cry and scream and my mind would think of the worst thing that could ever happen, would happen.

As I grew into my teenage years, I had pretty bad social anxiety, nothing crazy, but I was very shy, awkward and timid, hating talking in front of people, found it hard to not believe that everyone was judging me, staring at me, mocking me. especially considering I was a bit weird and not the most attractive person either.

Then now. A year ago I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever experienced, it came on suddenly, but looking back, it was slowly creeping up. I kept having awful thoughts that I was going to choke on food, every time I ate, I would be terrified I was going to die. One night, I was eating some sweets and chilling with my boyfriend and then boom ! I’m spiralling into a panic attack, running around the house telling my sister and nephew that I’m scared I’m choking (even though I’m speaking and breathing fine) I was convinced I was going to die. 
After that night, my panic would go on, I couldn’t sleep, eat, go to work, I was stuck. My anxiety started to show as health anxiety, I would have terrible thoughts about my health and about dying, any small symptoms I had I would panic and start all over again. 

Over the past year I’ve started to slowly get better, I have my problems here and there but I know there’s always hope. 
I hope whoever is reading this, can reach a place where they feel content and not controlled by their anxiety. I know how difficult it can be, especially to fall back into old habits that just make our anxiety worse. you’ve got this ! ","Anxiety"

"1750637588","Panic attacks about antibiotic","So I struggle really really badly with health anxiety and OCD and right now I’m on an antibiotic for a bad staph infection.

The medication was making me a little dizzy so I googled if that was normal (which it’s a common side effect) but then it also said it can be a sign of a more serious side effect that causes increased cranial pressure and lead to blindness.

Well where I live at right now it’s averaging about 97-99*F and 91% humidity which high heat and humidity have always given me sinus pressure and dizziness.

So now I’m sitting here panicked trying to decide if I’m dizzy and have a headache from 1) a normal medication side effect 2) the weather plus medication or 3) internal cranial pressure.

I called my doctor and he’s like just look out for visual signs like blurry vision or loss of vision or visual snow- well
Sometimes my vision gets weird during anxiety attacks too so now I’m sitting here overly monitoring convinced it’s happening.

I’m trying to calm down and be rational. I need this medication because I’m allergic to the other antibiotic used to treat moderate staph infections, and my staph is doing so much better. I literally only have 6 doses left to take and I’m done.  

It’s such a rare side effect and I really think it’s probably the weather mixed with my medication but then I’m just unsure if my vision is different and I should be worried. But I can’t keep rushing to the doctor every single time- I’ve seen my doctor 5 times this month. I even got a CT scan for appendicitis that I didn’t have. 

I’m in therapy and working with OCD but I’ve just started the OCD protocol stuff and the anxiety is just being an absolute beast. I just need to be rational and I’m failing that and I’m driving my family crazy with my continual worrying. ","Anxiety"

"1750648367","Tips with dealing with exposure therapy","Hey I've been struggling with anxiety around going out to restaurants and busy places where leaving isn't easy/somewhat socially acceptable, with all the common annoying heart rate spike/nausea/tight chest symptoms.

I was reccomened exposure therapy and have been attempting it when I can but it seems like it's taking such a long time to see any benefits and is killing my self confidence. Like I've managed to eat a meal in a restaurant by myself but it was pretty rough and the thought of doing it again it's stupidly anxiety inducing. 

Each time I do something like this it feels like I'm starting from square one again rather than a slightly less anxious place. The symptoms don't seem to be easing up, even though I know exposure therapy should be helping. 

Does anyone have any success stories or tips on how exposure therapy has helped them, id absolutely love to hear them all.

Thanks! ","Anxiety"
"1750648232","i don’t want to live knowing i might be suffering from an invisible illness.","health anxiety, i don’t wish this upon anyone. 

i am a 19(F) and the thought of cancer at such a young age is the worst. i don’t think cancer has ran through my family, though i am unsure if my biological dad whom i’ve never met before has it. i never had a family doctor, nor consistent doctor visits up until i was 16. i always thought my mother was a bit neglectful of my health and dentist visit, especially now that she took me off her insurance, it harder to seek medical advice. so ofcourse now that i am older, i feel like my body is betraying me. 

just ever since i’ve gotten back from hawaii (the last time i felt mentally & physically happy) i have been dealing with some swollen areas of my face (my PCP never said if it was a lymph node but it definitely was) & when i got it checked out, i’ve been diagnosed with tmj as well. amoxicillin helped the swelling of my swollen areas go down however my tmj was the last thing i had to deal with.. nothing could go wrong right?

well now i am experiencing trouble swallowing and clicking, acid reflux, lump feeling in throat, and muscle tightness. i googled every symptom i had which is horrible for health anxiety and there is just so much stuff that could be related to my symptoms, you just don’t know what. i convinced my stepdad to just book a doctors appointment and hopefully its not a “no issues” type answer. 

i dont want this to sound like my parents do not care about me, they just try to reassure me everything is fine & im still young they say. but cancer can literally start at any age. i’m pretty sure they just want to avoid medical bills. i would hate to spend so much too honestly.. however, i am in pain, discomfort, and having so much anxiety knowing i might be dealing with this forever. i wake up to new things everyday & i’m just like “damn.. i’m still here” i just need answers but also that’s so scary.. wether it’s esophagus cancer, or a rare clicking larynx syndrome, i dont want to live like this. i would rather die, but attempting is something i just cannot do for the life of me.","Anxiety"

"1750646780","I suspected PTSD but was diagnosed with GAD","As of last year, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Autism. I had already suspected Autism, but the former sort of caught me off-guard. I didn't go around saying that I totally had PTSD or anything, I didn't even count it as a self-diagnosis--just a hunch, I suppose. But also not really? One of my special interests is psychology, so I genuinely did a LOT of research before realizing that I may have PTSD. Scouting for disorders wasn't even my intention when I started learning about mental health, I simply wanted to improve my life and understand myself better.

To elaborate, I've also experienced prolonged, excessive childhood trauma that lasted for over a decade. I'll spare you the details, but just know that things weren't going great for me in any aspect of my life. My symptoms aligned almost perfectly with what was required for a PTSD diagnosis, and I also HEAVILY related to nearly everything I heard from people who did have PTSD. From behaviors to emotions to even how I processed basic information. So, I was taken a bit by surprise when I was instead informed that I had something else. Not that I didn't know of other trauma-caused disorders, but it just wasn't what I was expecting, I suppose?

For further context, I do not have frequent flashbacks, nightmares, or anything of the sort. But I did have them when I was younger, VERY often. However, I waited multiple years before asking my mother for a diagnosis, during which I genuinely had a very strong recovery. I still feel proud (and a bit bittersweet) when I think of how miserable and scared I used to be in comparison to how much happier I've become. Don't get me wrong, I'm still traumatized; I can't argue with my mom in any situation, it causes me so much distress and usually leads to panic attacks. But I don't have many flashbacks nowadays.

So I'm sure that this all sounds a bit silly, but I'm just curious I guess. Has anyone else here experienced something like this? What really are the differences between PTSD and GAD that's been created from trauma? Is there anything you would like to note?","Anxiety"

It doesn’t last the whole day usually and doesn’t really hurt but I guess can sometimes feel a little sore. The interesting thing is that I notice is happens when I’m not actively anxious or stressed. My husband said that when he had bad anxiety a similar thing happened to him. Can anyone else speak to this? I read some stuff about the body being in fight or flight during times of anxiousness. And that anxiety can cause muscle and nerves to tighten I guess.

I’ve found that I’m only really finding comfort from my boyfriend and living with my family. I’ve never felt dependent like this before, and I’m not sure if it’s healthy to rely on being around my boyfriend to feel okay and at peace for once. It’s scary, I should be a capable adult and I keep having a crisis

My anxiety has been coming out in flares. I get over one thing, and now I’m scared of another thing. It’s been awful. But the fact that I come out the other side and return to myself has me thinking maybe I can just push through? It does feel really isolating and I’m scared I won’t be able to function on my own. I need to be with my family and my boyfriend, but that’s just how I feel. I have to be functional for my final year of university coming up, I’m worried I’ll crash again.

Should I try therapy? Is it okay to be dependent on others or do I need to change that? I do have a psychologist who’s helping with my autism diagnosis and I’m not sure if I should talk about my anxiety.

"1750640777","Anxiety and Heart Sensations","Hello,

I am 23F and 3 days ago I felt these two heavy thumps in my heart that took my breath away followed immediately by what I believe to be my first ever panic attack. Air hunger, feeling like I was going to die, etc. Went to the ER and they did tests and found nothing. Today I went back to the ER because I was having those thumps/flutters a lot more frequently and had another panic attack. I was there for about 5 hours and the whole time they had me hooked up. More tests, same results. Which is to say nothing is seriously wrong with my heart. Which of course I’m glad to hear, but even while they were monitoring I would have these thumps/flutters. It kind of feels like when your stomach drops on a roller coaster except in my heart area. They didn’t pick up any PVC’s the whole time I was hooked up. I explained to them I was still having the sensation despite them saying they weren’t seeing anything. They gave me a GI cocktail and anti-nausea meds and sent me home. I have an appointment with a PCP tomorrow and a cardiologist appointment on the 8th of July. I really don’t know what to think or do. I’ve never had something that affects my daily life in such a disruptive way before. I’ve never had something so scary that it leaves me with thoughts like “what if this is forever, what if this is my new normal?” I miss just 4 days ago when I felt completely normal. The sensations are worse when laying down but happen when I am sitting and standing as well. I also feel what I can only describe as a tightness in my chest. I also have a hard time sleeping or fully relaxing because of these sensations in my chest. Feeling hopeless and powerless. Doing what I can and trying to remind myself they didn’t find anything scary both times I went to the ER. I have been extremely anxious about the Iran/Israel stuff and doomscrolling a lot more frequently the last several weeks so I wonder if it’s related and it has just hit a cumulative point. I’ve since stopped going on social media to give my mind a break. But again I don’t know if this is the cause it’s just a guess I have. Not sure what I am looking for in this post. Support, guidance, etc I suppose. I used the flair “venting” but this could also fall under health or advice needed. Feeling pretty low right now. I hope I get better.

"1750640233","Why are good therapists so impossible to find?","I have been in and out of therapy and medication management for 5 years and have never had a good experience with a therapist. 

My very first session ever the therapist tried to psychoanalyze me, claiming to have found my issue immediately. He hyper fixated on me mentioning that I regretted missing my sister plan her wedding because I was halfway across the country working a job I hated at the time. He told me I was resentful of her and subconsciously didn't want her to get married, and that if I didn't move past it I would end up never speaking to her again. My sister who I love, was maid of honor to, and now dote on my newborn nephew, but sure, I'm resentful. He would not drop it, would not let me get another word in the entire session.

My second therapist forced me to take lamotrigine despite me telling her it made my anxiety skyrocket. She was convinced it was the perfect medication for me, despite me telling her again and again that the first time I took it my anxiety got so bad I couldn't drive because I thought I would wreck, couldn't leave my home for more than an hour or two because I was convinced my dog would die alone at home, and often couldn't even eat because I was convinced I would choke and die. She flat out told me she would not prescribe me anything else until I agreed to try the lamotrigine again and document in detail my side effects. She wanted me to keep a journal and write down the date, time, place, and what I was doing during every panic attack because she was convinced something other than the drug was causing my anxiety to spike and she wanted to find a pattern. She was also incredibly racist and trauma dumped on me about how (pardon the crude statement) her daughter was ""r*ped by a d*rty ill*gal."" An absolutely disgusting thing to say in any context, but especially to a patient. Obviously I never went back to her after that.

My most recent therapist absolutely refuses to take any notes, and therefore I have had the exact same conversation with her during every visit. She rushes through the appointments (supposed to be 15minutes, but none have been over 10) continues to have my dosing of my medication wrong, and does not document anything. I currently take a very low dose of my medication, not because I barely need it, but because it makes me dizzy (buspirone is KNOWN to do that) so I can only take it at night before bed. Otherwise I'd be dizzy during the day at work. I've told her this at every session, and yet our most recent one she had the gall to tell me she thinks my anxiety is improving because I'm lowering my dose. She then refused to sign an ESA letter (I'm moving and have a dog) because she thinks an ESA is unnecessary because said anxiety is improving. 

I just don't understand why good therapists and psychiatrists are so impossible to find. Have I just had the worst possible luck and managed to find 3 absolute duds, or is this a universal issue? Unfortunately I have to find another one so I can stay on my medication, but I'm terrified of finding yet another horrible provider. ","Anxiety"

So, as an exercise to show how much of a trickster anxiety is, what are you afraid is gonna happen when you have a panic attack?","Anxiety"
"1750621062","Super anxious about an upcoming dental appointment","Hi all :) 

For the longest I can remember, I've had a fear of anything medical related. I'm petrified of needles, hospitals terrify me and dentists especially leave me feeling incredibly anxious. 

When I was younger (15 at the time, 25 now,) I had a very traumatic experience with my last dentist. They were incredibly unempathetic, made a point of showing me the needle and were unfortunately very heavy handed during their procedure during a filling that hurt me physically. This caused me to fear the dentist and I never went back for an appointment.

Some months ago, I found decay on my wisdom tooth. I'm usually pretty good with my dental hygiene, but I guess I wasn't getting to that area in particular as well as I could have. I bit the bullet and booked in with a new dentist, because I'd rather not get an abcess and it's the right thing to do regardless. 

I guess I'm just terrified. My appointment is next week (it took a few months for my appointment because the UK is pretty dire rn,) and I cannot stop thinking about it. I'm expecting to be told the tooth needs to be removed, it's grown in at an awkward angle (towards the cheek, fully breached,) and they'll probably say because of the difficulty of cleaning, it's the best option... I'd much rather a filling, truly. The needle is gonna happen anyway but I really don't want to go through an extraction due to my fears.

I guess I just need some support 😅 and if there are any dentists here, all the better. I have brilliant support from my family, friends and partner, but sometimes it's nice to get an outside perspective. 

Thank you all 🫂","Anxiety"
"1750620690","I have a blood test coming up and I’m worried I’ll have a panic attack","Hello, this is my first post on Reddit and I just wanted to ask for some advice as I have a blood test coming up in a couple of weeks that is causing me immense anxiety. 

I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for around six years, but just over a month ago I had a severe panic attack and I haven’t been the same since. Every situation, such as getting on the bus or even going outside the house, causes a panic attack. 

I have talked with my therapist about this, but the last session I went to I freaked out outside the room and spent our entire session having waves of anxiety so bad that she’s suggested that we stop in person sessions and move to online due to my reaction to being in public. 

Anyway, that’s just a bit of background, my problem is that I contacted my gp with some symptoms I’ve been having (not to do with anxiety), and they requested a blood test in just under two weeks. At first I felt okay about it, I have no fear of needles or blood, but over the last couple of days my anxiety about the situation has increased. 

I believe this is due to the fact that I’m afraid even being in the waiting room will bring on a panic attack, and I get even more anxious if people see/talk to me when I’m in that state. My panic attacks in themselves make me feel nauseous, though I have never thrown up (that’s another massive fear of mine), lightheaded, shaky, and like I can’t breath. 

I’m terrified that I will get into the appointment and will have a panic attack, and therefore not be able to get a blood test, which will only worsen my anxiety as I’ll feel as if there’s something wrong with me I’ll have missed the opportunity to find out what. 

I would really appreciate any help/advice with this as I want to make sure I can do this appointment without freaking out and leaving, and I really have no hope in myself that I’ll be able to be calm enough to have the blood test.

So... I 25f(uk)  have a job interview on Tuesday and my anxiety is through the roof... I know it's only as bad as it is because because of so many bad experiences in my last job. 

My last manager was so toxic, when I first started she was literally paying me £2 per hour, she once called me a r**ard Purley because I asked for help, relentlessly commented about my ""abnormally large hands"" and so many other things. The thing that pushed me over the edge was when I overheared her begging one of my colleagues to come in the next day because it was only me and her due to be in and apparently I was ""useless and incapable"" 🙃

it’s currently 4:30am and i have work at 9! i’ve been feeling like this since last week. i cannot sleep. 

every time i close my eyes my heart starts racing so hard i can feel it in my stomach. i’ve previously been medicated but all my medications are out of date now. i’m not sure what to do at this point :’). i have an appointment booked for a few weeks but that was the earliest i can book in. 

i’m stressed about a lot of things but i havnt had any  major issues with my anxiety since i was 18 and im now 22. ive been feeling like im going to have a heart attack for the last few days. 

the current political climate is making things far worse (to the point i booked a dr appt to discuss my chronic pain and mental health issues to make sure it’s on my record 💀 unreasonable i know) so ive been doing my best to stay off social media where i can. i can keep myself semi distracted at the moment but as soon as i have to go to sleep i just freak out and want to cry. i’ve felt sick to my stomach, i feel like im going to throw up. 
i have general anxiety definitely im just a bit at a loss right now and dont have anyone to talk to about it. i feel very stuck, my room hasnt been properly cleaned since the start of the year and its june. i feel disgusting and sick now and i cant even rot in my own yuck cuz i have to go to work and be a functioning adult. i’ve been drawing to give myself a hobby but ive just ended up putting my entire self worth onto that and now when i cant draw to my best ability i feel even worse. my sister boyfriend is always at our house and him being in my space makes me wildly uncomfortable so i cant relax properly and ive been struggling with being out of place since last may. my mum cant just not have him over but it feels like hes here 5-6 days a week even though we made a limit of 4 which i think is still a lot. 

sorry for ranting,, i have a support system but my mum also struggles with her mental health and my dad doesn’t really understand it but he tries. it just feels silly because my current issues (politics) are completely out of my control. i’ve never felt this anxious in my life and it’s never effected me like this before. 

i’ll keep trying to get better and hopefully can get back on my meds. i just started my job (not causing stress i worked here previously just renamed my role) so i have no sick leave and cant take any time to try and recoup myself. lots going on and i feel mentally and physically at the worst i’ve ever been 💕","Anxiety"

"1750629968","Possible Syncope Episode","Hi all,

I posted this in AskDocs, but I’m still spiraling and could use some reassurance. I have GAD and health anxiety. 

Yesterday, I fainted and vomited during a movie. I had a migraine most of the day, but still did some yard work. It was really hot outside and I felt a little nauseas, but that cleared up quickly. I had an energy drink before that, and a Gatorade after. I have not been good about drinking a lot of water…

A few hours later, I went to the movies and had some alcohol (~2 drinks), and some popcorn. I felt very full, like my food wasn’t digesting. About 2/3rds into the movie, I started to feel extremely hot and tingly, and started to get tunnel vision. Next thing I knew, my wife was asking me if she should call an ambulance because I vomited. She thought I fell asleep at first. 

Ended up in the hospital, EKG, labs, chest x ray, head CT scan all normal. The ER doc gave me some referrals to a cardiologist and a neurologist to follow up, so I’m setting up those appointments. 

Thinking back, it’s possible this happened a few months ago. Exact same symptoms while I was on a plane, but I came to while I was starting to vomit. The only difference is I had more to drink that time (nervous flyer). 

Does this sound like vasovagal syncope? I’m extremely anxious right now and could use any reassurance.

"1750616008","health anxiety","i’ve struggled with health anxiety for the better part of a couple years now. it all started after i noticed a swollen lymph node years ago that never went away. multiple doctors visits, intense rumination, fear, crying, all until i got confirmation that the growth i felt was in fact benign. this started kind of a new theme
for my OCD that has just progressively gotten worse. I’ve probably diagnosed myself with every type of cancer under the sun at this point. wasted money on pointless doctors visits, and wasted so many hours going down rabbit holes on google. it always would be some weird pain that i’d immediately attribute to some type of cancer. it got so bad i’ve even gaslit myself into thinking my eyes were yellow with jaundice (they weren’t.) i thought i’d seen the worst until my mind somehow, somewhere, and for some reason that i can’t figure out made me think of neurological issues. since then, i’ve seen one of the worst mental health spirals of my life. muscle twitching, shaking, wobbliness, random fleeting numbness in every one of my limbs, tight muscles, all started happening. 

i freaked out, worrying i have *** or some rare motor neuron disease. it was horrible. never had any actual objective loss of strength, but the constant hyper vigilance has caused me to second guess every normal sensation. every little clumsy mistake i’d immediately scrutinize. “am i losing strength in my hands? am i able to stand normal? why does this feel easier with my right hand than my left hand? maybe i should just test out my strength until im certain im not feeling weak”. while probably a product of my OCD, i would second guess every sensation, sending me further down the spiral. of course the more i entertained this thought, the worse the symptoms got. my muscles twitch out of control all over my body. i wake up and immediately feel my heart racing, and feel just shaky and off. the connection between neurological issues and the effect of my anxiety and imagination wreaked havoc on me. 

the point i want to make is anxiety itself when teamed up with fear or our imaginations can make normal things feel abnormal. and further anxiety itself can be so powerful when it manifests physically. but feeding the loop only worsens it. if anyone else is struggling with something similar, just know you’re not alone and understand how powerful anxiety can be even physically. i’m working hard to stop feeding the loop, trying to stay off doctor google who tells me every benign sensation could possibly be (insert rare fatal debilitating disease). if anyone else is experiencing something similar feel free to reach out. it helps knowing you’re not crazy and other people are going through the same thing.

I'm not sure if this is the right place, but at this point my anxiety has gotten so bad that I felt the need to reach out here.

On April 27th, 2025, I was hit by a car while getting out of mine, just about to step onto the sidewalk. I didn’t see it coming — the blindspots on the small residential street hid the car. My son was with me that day, and I instinctively moved to protect him, taking the hit myself. It broke my right femur and completely changed my life. The trauma and pain caused my anxiety and depression to spiral. I was given anxiety medication in the hospital because I was shaking so badly.

I went through a 2-week rehab program and did really well in PT. I was walking again, using a cane, slowly getting my life back. But then a blood clot was found two weeks after I got home, which set me back. I had to stop everything. Once I was cleared by my vascular doctor, I restarted PT, walking again and making progress.

Then it all came crashing down again — I pushed too hard doing lunges. Now the doctor thinks I may have sprained my LCL or possibly torn my cartilage. All the rehab and pain I endured in May feels like it was for nothing. I can barely walk again. My knee swells. The pain feels different now. It's not just about the femur anymore.

I’m so angry and my anxiety is out of control. I'm constantly stuck in ""what if"" thoughts: What if I stay like this? What if I’m never able to walk normally again? What if my leg stays stiff forever? My family doesn’t understand. They keep yelling at me to “stop being so negative,” that “I’ll be fine,” and “I won’t stay stuck like this.” I know they mean well and believe in me — they’ve seen me fight so hard from day one. But it's so hard.

I’ve been fighting since the day of the accident — I walked the next day, I pushed through PT, I’ve been doing it for my children. But now I feel like I pushed too hard and broke something again. I’m starting over. I’m scared.

I have my MRI tomorrow and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m anxious, terrified of what it might show. I just wish my family could understand what I’m going through inside. I'm exhausted.

One of the biggest mistakes I made with mental health was thinking that it was going to improve on it's own.

**""I'm going to start exercising, getting sun, meditating, etc. - once I feel happier""**

I say this with love but sadly, that's not how it works.

We need to do the actions first, and if we stay consistent - change happens.

Luckily we can do the actions DESPITE feeling anxious. DESPITE feeling sad. DESPITE feeling unmotivated.

I also understand how crippling anxiety can feel, and if you're at that point - you're not going to do an intense workout at the public gym right away, but make the actions **so small** that it's impossible to not take the win.

* Go for a walk in the sun.
* Can't do that? 
* Go watch a YouTube home work out or yoga video and try to follow.
* Still too hard?
* Listen to music and dance.
* Need it smaller?
* Stand up and stretch. (See where this is going?)

  
**Start stacking the small wins and slowly work your way up.**

When you do the actions for long enough, one day you'll wake up and think ""oh wow, I'm not feeling as bad as I used to be"" :)

I've spoken with various parents regarding this and have had no luck getting it to stop, so I've had to learn to live with the banging, footballs repeatedly being kicked into our garden, repeat knocking of the door asking for footballs back, and children climbing into our garden without permission to get the footballs themselves. This has been going on for 7 years and increases in frequency in spring and summer.

I am aware of how silly this sounds, but it does become very disturbing to our lives/routines - particularly on weeknights when the children are out of school for holiday periods and can sometimes disturb us as late as 11pm or midnight when we are in bed for work the next morning. They are just children, and I fully understand this, so I have accepted to live with that.

What I'm unable to live with is the anxiety I now have regarding all of the above. I feel like it was triggered when a window of our home was eventually smashed. It was accidental, but I now live with very bad anxiety every day in my own home. I feel like it's not normal to feel this anxious from the moment I wake over children playing. I live in fear of something else happening and dread the sound of them making their way towards our house.

I've found myself in a rut of self sabotage, where I've conditioned myself to be unable to relax and enjoy things like hobbies in my own home until I know the children will be at home, in bed for the evening, and I can do what I want to do without disturbances.

Could this be at a level where I need to seek professional help, like speaking to my GP or going to therapy? I'm driving myself crazy!

"1750617422","Something is breaking down for me","I’ll start with I’ve been dealing with anxiety in one way or another since I was in 10th grade, now 39.  It took until about 13 years ago to get a full panic attack that resulted in the hospital visits, EKG’s, cardiac stress tests, blood work, etc.  No problems with any of that.  I HAD been in Viibyrd (stomach issues were the worst) for almost all of those 13 years until it started to wear off in late ‘24 so I started to taper and go onto Prozac.  Started at 10, anxiety still there, 20 felt much better for a few weeks but not resolved, upped to 40 and it’s like it didn’t do anything.  Worse, probably. 
Now, most of my panic has been around health.  Fear of heart attack until I was able to convince myself otherwise.  Lots of bloating in the upper stomach and nerve twitches in the chest that would set off my anxiety.  This is different though…
I’m feeling deep loneliness and really intense thoughts that I just can’t do this anymore.  Not that I’m “making plans” but more like nothing is ever going to help and I’m going to stay in this terrified panic phase forever.  It’s really debilitating in that I’m scared of doing any exercise, scared of playing with my kids too hard and get hit in the chest, etc.  Also, LOVE traveling and only recently have noticed how exposed I am when in an airplane, off deep in the forest with no cell signal while fly fishing, driving through the country, you get it.
Another thing is it all ramps up tremendously at night so I genuinely fear when the sun goes down and I have to make my way to bed to deal with anxiety until I fall asleep.
Having a few beers takes the anxiety from 1000 to absolutely 0.  Awful habit and thankfully not a problem yet as I’m really intentional about staying away from bringing that in.

Anyway, wanted some emergency assistance/hope from this group.  Should I think about switching off of Prozac even though I just got up to full strength?  Klonopin helps but hate the tolerance it builds up (.25mg 2x per day).  Also do 10mg. Propranolol 2x per day.  

Just to add, I’ve started seeing a therapist for CBT because I’m determined to kill my anxiety this year but often times I just tell her my worries for 1.5 hrs then leave.  ","Anxiety"
"1750603114","Does anyone have very specific fears?","I’m not trying to invalidate anyone btw even if it sounds like it.

It feels like the more and more I look at this subreddit, even though I’m diagnosed with GAD, I relate to it less and less. Everyone on here talks about being anxious about anything and everything, things that I’ve never been anxious about, like wars and storms and health and everyone has panic attacks about those things, or sometimes randomly about nothing. I often am able to look at everything analytically and logically and extinguish those fears as they rise.  

It feels like the only things that make me extremely anxious is my house burning down, having to initiate talking to someone, and I always spiral about feeling like I’m a narcissist and I’m manipulating everyone around me. 

I’ve thought about OCD but my psychologist told me that I don’t score a single thing in the OCD diagnostic criteria. He did however put in his notes that I have what’s called “specific phobia” and that’s a nod to my fear of fire that I’ve mentioned multiple times. I will engage in compulsive behaviors because of that fear, like not plugging anything in or counting to three before I turn off the light switch after it was only on for a couple minutes, and those type of things. I thought they were signs of OCD but the psychologist said that I needed to do it with other things and not just my fear of fire. It’s odd because I’ve never been around fire or impacted by fire. 

I tried to make this as coherent as possible but if you need me to reiterate anything I will.","Anxiety"
"1750616278","Fawning.","Does anyone do this when experiencing an anxiety attack or a panic attack? I do, and afterwards, I’m irritated with myself that I didn’t speak my mind. I look like a milk toast wimp to whoever I was talking with because I agree with them or don’t speak my true mind when responding to a question. If you don’t know what fawning is, it’s the fourth method of reacting to a threat. Fight, flight, freeze or fawn. To fawn is to avoid or minimize distress or danger by pleasing or appeasing the threat. I respond like this to keep the threat or abuser happy, despite my own needs or desires. Just curious if anyone else does this and if you might have any advice for me?","Anxiety"
"1750594426","7 years with Health anxiety","I’ve had health anxiety for 7 years now. I’ve probably had it my whole life after a traumatic experience I had when I was 12. I’ve had my highs and lows but most of the time now it seems to be lows. Everyday is a struggle. I try to tell myself it will get better and I don’t do much more than telling myself that, I know I should be more proactive with self help but I am stuck with that feeling of “it probably won’t help”.

I am currently undergoing an adult autism diagnosis and hopefully that will give some clarity to some of my anxiety. More recently my triggers seem to be social occasions and lots of noise.

One thing I will say is I don’t let it stop me from doing things, most of the time I know I’ll be anxious but push through anyway (feels like hell).

This post is basically just post to see if anyone suffers with health anxiety or maybe you have a touch of the tism too and would kindly share your experiences or what helps you or has helped you in the past?

"1750615297","physical anxiety encouragement","hi all, just looking for some support and encouragement, please note that I start some new therapy next week and so hopefully that will help what I’m going through right now - but it’s been really hard so I’d love to know if anyone else struggles with this.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and PTSD symptoms since I was very young, and it’s been a while since it’s manifested physically in a new way. For the majority of my life, I feel like I know what my anxiety feels like, and I know what my nervous system dysfunction feels like, but recently I had what I would define as a nervous breakdown and since then it’s all changed. I feel like something “snapped” and my foundation is totally messed up. My anxiety symptoms have been so bad that I can’t breathe, I’m fainting, my mind fog and disassociation is worse than it’s ever been, my nervous system is so worked up and it’s incredibly difficult to regulate. 

due to the severity of these symptoms, I’ve been struggling with new fears like:

- fear of dying (like slipping into unconsciousness)
- fear of dying while i’m alone (not being able to breathe/fainting and no one being able to help me)
- fear of going “insane” (losing my grip on reality and never being able to return to normalcy, fear of not feeling connected to my body, my symptoms increasing to the “point of no return”

I know that these fears exacerbate the physical symptoms, this is something that used to happen to me when I was really young, so I know my body can trick me, but any encouragement that I am OK and that I am taking the steps I need to by seeking professional help would be so appreciated. I feel so vulnerable and scared.

"1750615233","Weed related vent","So over the last two weeks I have been experiencing the worst anxiety I've ever had in my life. My anxiety manifests almost exclusively as physical symptoms and it is exhausting... For years I had stomach pain / nausea and I was constantly at the doctor's/ hospital, I had every test done until I knew it was 100% healthy and eventually the symptoms got a bit better.

 More recently I've been having horrendous symptoms with my throat and chest - that I hope are just down to anxiety but it can be hard to reassure yourself. My throat constantly feels tight and tense and like there's something stuck in it, my chest also feels tight and it feels as though I can't breathe properly most of the time. 

So on to the weed part... I'm 21 and I've been smoking weed pretty much every day since I was 16, it's always helped with my anxiety, especially the painful physical symptoms, and it's never interfered with my life (holding down jobs, studying , etc). It's a huge part of my routine, and it's always been more effective than any medication I've been prescribed... Until recently. 
Since having this issue with my throat/ chest, every time I smoke my it makes my symptoms 10x worse, to the point it's basically panic attack inducing.

 I don't know if anyone can relate or if anyone had advice? These symptoms are really freaking me out, I've never experienced anything like it, it's like my chest is being crushed and my throat is closed up :( anxiety sucks man ","Anxiety"

"1750600663","Managing Anxiety","Hi friends! I'm new to this subreddit but I would like some advice. 
I have an anxiety disorder and am non medicated for various reasons I won't get into here. As a part of my anxiety I get really paranoid and anxious if I have to spend the night in a house alone (I also have a fear of home invasions). I don't live with family, I live with 2 housemates who have gone camping for the week so that means I'll be alone at home the entire time save for a couple times I'll have friends over. 
I was wondering if anyone had advice or tips for anxiety management to help me sleep. My current plan is to sleep in the living room with a couple lights on while youtube or a comfort show plays, and just stay awake until I physically can't, but I know that isn't really a good idea to do for the whole week. How can I manage my anxiety during this time?  Thank you! ","Anxiety"
"1750614208","Anxiety Before Practice Every Day :(","Hey everyone, I just needed to vent a bit or see if anyone can relate. I do a super competitive sport, and every single day before practice, I get this huge wave of anxiety. It’s not even about competing—just practice. I think a big part of it is feeling like I don’t always know what I’m doing, and that just sends me into a full panic spiral.

It’s frustrating because I want to be excited to go and get better, but instead my stomach is in knots and I feel like I can’t breathe right up until it starts. Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who’s anxious, while everyone else seems confident and chill, which makes it worse.

"1750614005","I am just so tired","On May 27th, 2019, I woke up and felt like something was wrong with me. A week later, I ended up in ER because I had some sort of a seizure which was categorised as a panic attack. 

Here I am in 2025, struggling for years to get my life back. I was diagnosed with a panic disorder, and I also have agoraphobia. I can’t go anywhere alone. I am in therapy, taking my antidepressants, doing yoga, breathing exercises, absolutely everything in my power to heal. 

Things finally started to get a bit better in March. I could go out on my own for a bit, walk around my neighborhood. And then I lost my job. Everything went downhill from there. I was already living paycheck to paycheck, since I had to accept a lower pay for remote work. I had saved some money to get me through in case of emergency, but it’s about to run out. 

I tried to find anything to do online, but I was rejected numerous times. I don’t have any friends because I wasn’t fun anymore after the panic disorder diagnosis. I can only talk about it to my therapist, but I see her every three weeks (because I don’t have money at the moment). 

And this morning, I had a horrible panic attack. I thought I was losing my mind/control of my body and got even more scared I might harm one of my neighbours if anyone tried to help me. So I lay down and accepted that whatever happens, it happens. 

I managed to calm down after 30 minutes (or so), but afterward, I felt even worse. I want my life back. I want to have friends, find a normal job (not slave remote work), go out for coffee on my own, buy groceries like every other normal person. 

I am just so tired of this. 

So sorry for the rant, but I literally have no one to turn to right now, and I had to get it off my chest.

The discomfort, the nausea… I can barely stand it. I feel hunger, but food turns to ash in my mouth, a chore that needs to be performed, not enjoyed. I confided in three separate instances with people I felt safe confiding in, and the results were SO disappointing. Every person, without fail, told me they wished they had my problem, that overeating was so much worse. My sister even said it’s for the best because I had wanted to lose some weight before her wedding. I just can’t explain, without feeling privileged… how I have no energy when I can’t eat.

"1750613209","My friend (18F) told me (21F) I’m insensitive for being anxious about the current political situations regarding the US.","Hi there! A situation with my friend happened yesterday evening and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong or not.

A little background info— I am very openly left leaning and regularly post to raise awareness for causes aligning with left values, attend protests, etc. I am also chronically anxious. I have diagnosed OCD & PTSD, along with anxiety, depression, autism, etc. My friends all know these things and it is no secret to them regarding my identity and who I am as a person.

My friend (18F), who I’ll call Sue for the sake of anonymity, told me that I was being insensitive for feeling anxious regarding the United State’s current political/nuclear affairs. Sue told me that compared to the middle east, we are not in a war and we have no reason to feel anxious when we’ve already destroyed so many lives of middle easterners. 

At first I was confused, because logically, it’s not like I’m the one telling the leaders of this country to bomb other people. It’s not like I voted for that. I’ve advocated for ceasefire and have publicly posted and voiced my opinion so it’s not like I’m just tone deaf to the world. 

But, it made me feel bad. It made me feel like I don’t have a place to feel anxious or paranoid over the idea of war retaliation. I truly do feel bad for those in the Middle East that have been victims to this genocide. They absolutely did not deserve that and they still do not deserve it. 

I’m just dealing with a little guilt and feeling like maybe Sue is right and I am insensitive and shitty for being anxious. I’d love if I could get some thoughts on this mentality.","Anxiety"

"1750611675","Should I complete Anxiety questionnaire from Drs? [Please read for context]","9 months ago, I reached a bit of a crisis point with my anxiety and went to the doctors begging for help. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression and prescribed Sertraline. I was also referred for NHS therapy, and upon completing the assessment labelled as a critical case. 

I then waited 6 months for therapy. In that time, I started the Sertraline, and it completely changed my life. After a bumping transition phase for a couple of weeks, I felt amazing - like the best version of myself. Not at all anxious, very relaxed, happy and excited about life again.

When I got to the top of the wait list and got my first therapy session through, they sent an assessment form I had to complete pre-session. It was the same as the original one I completely when first referred, however, of course my answers were now very different. No, I didn't feel worthless anymore, or struggle to go to work, or lie awake all night having panic attacks, or have loss of appetite. BUT I still needed the therapy to help me learn the techniques to cope if the feelings came back again.

I decided to be truthful in the form and as a result, at the start of what was meant to be my first session, was told I no longer needed therapy. I was healed in the eyes of the NHS !!! They said their therapy is for critical cases and I am no longer a critical case. I said, *but I was a critical case, and had I not gone on the medication in the mean time, upon hearing I'd have to wait 6 months for therapy, god knows where I'd be ?!* but alas, they had more critical people who needed my spot I guess.

**ANYWAY**

I have now been on Sertraline for those 9 months and it has transformed my life and mental health, and giving me the life jacket I needed to build mental strength and get my life back on track. 

Yesterday, I received a messaged from my doctors asking me to complete a questionnaire on my health. Upon opening it, I can see it is a similar mental health questionnaire to the therapy assessment. 

Based on what happened with that, I'm a but nervous to complete it in case they try to take me off Sertraline.

My BP dropped suddenly in my sleep causing me to become unresponsive and needingcpr.

My poor husband got THE phone call to come to the hospital immediately and I couldn't see my children while I was there. Did a tilt table test which showed my BP dropped up to 70% by standing for too long.  So recovery was fairly slow but was getting back on track.

- daughter slipped at home, knocked herself out. She was okay but it causes a panic attack  in my then 9 year old thinking he wouldnt see her for weeks.

- we found out my 9 year old was getting bullied at school by both students a the principal (very small country school. To the point other parents were ringing me to tell me what they had been told was happening to him. Got him in play therapy and just pulled him out of school early.

- was feeling quite unwell one morning and went to my doctor, he looked at me and called an ambulance. I was blue lighted to hospital put in resus and then in icu for two weeks with septic shock. Was in a general ward for another week then allowed home. Again I only saw my kids on facetime. Recovery was long both mentally and physically. Dr's realised I had been put on a new bp medication which caused my BP to drop too low which international started liver and kidney failure.

- next 3 months were spent with weekly blood test and trying to manage my BP with tiny incremental   medication doses which we finally got right.

- MIL died

-Xmas day started great, suddenly developed a high fever, called ambulance (due to septic shock before). Was admitted to HDU with urosepsis so was there 12 days.

2025
- received a phone call from my mother that my brothers wife had collapsed and died at home. (Again other side of the world).
- struggling with fatigue, pain, depression and anxiety. I usually have quite good management of these but I was completely overwhelmed. 

- husband diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer. It's a case of the best of the worst news and he doesn't need treatment yet.

-got a call from my oldest sons school (16 ys) he had been attending counselling through school and he had told her he was feeling suicidal. Luckily we have had good support from our GP and the local mental health team and seem to be on a good path.

- my 10 year old son developed asthma and was rushed to hospital 2 days in a row. We have since worked out it is mainly caused by anxiety and he is back in therapy. We are also in the process of trying to get him assessed for autism as there a definite traits. The actual autism part does not bother me in the least as it's these things that make him who he is, it's the process of trying to get him assessed.

The only brightside is I managed to stop smoking and I think after going through all this and not picking them up again, I have well and truly beat it!!

Than you for letting me get this of my chess, I think I just need to get it out without causing people to worry about me. Also I edited this as wasn't sure about formatting.","Anxiety"
"1750596031","Perhaps some Comfort during these Times","I've been trying not to freak out over everything. Last night I felt nauseous, got lightheaded, racing thoughts and speech, the whole 9 yards.

Then I got angry. Why let my anxiety steamroll my peace? The concerns are valid, and at the same time I cannot feel so constricted by anxiety that I cannot breathe over the “what ifs.” I’ve let it slowly drain and suffocate me for 23 years, so I’ve finally found myself submitting to any realistic, tangible solutions. I know not one size fits all, but perhaps it may help some:

The thought process that has kept me going though this is that if worse case scenario there is death, the threat of death is there and has been there for everyone all the time anyways. Forgive the cynicism, although being blunt with myself was grabbing my attention more. I could choke on my food or get in a car crash tomorrow and die. There are other unpredictable ways we could pass, and that is the daunting nature of life. These incidents could occur even earlier than the worse case scenario that we may fear from our current political climate. With that being said, my last moments would be wasted on fears of ""what if's."" 

And so, I’ve chosen to aggressively, passionately and mindfully live. I went to get a smoothie and enjoyed its mango taste in full. I drove with the windows down on the highway, so I could feel the wind hit me at just the right temperature. I breathed with my whole stomach and chest, cherishing those moments alive. Nurturing my body that fights to maintain that way. I knew my existence, in that moment, for that exact moment, was guaranteed for each act.

It is now today, the day you are reading this. You are alive to read this. What do you need and want to do with your guaranteed existence in this very moment, this very second? 

Listen to your body and mind. Get good food. Drink refreshing water. Pick up that book you’ve been wanting to read. Go on a run to burn the that energy. Watch that YouTuber that makes you laugh so hard your stomach aches. Finish that art piece that you feel proud of yourself for making. Play your favorite songs on your commute. Find the enjoyable moments at your place of work, like the sun pouring in, even smell of the soap in the bathroom. 

Your current existence is what you can control, in an uncontrollable world. Spit in the face of fear, try your best to enjoy the gift of this moment, even if it feels impossible. ","Anxiety"
"1750609439","Scared to Quit","I am going to be moving on from my job to school soon and I’m going to be putting in notice.
It’s not that my job or managers are really bad or anything I am just super anxious to quit.

My last(and first) job was the same, I actually put it off and off trying to find the right time to bring it up until my manager actually asked what my plans were and I could bring it up (I was planning on studying abroad at the time). 

I’m scared of even bringing it up. I’m scared of them having a big reaction like “oh we really need you here though!” Or upset that I’m leaving. I know my fears are irrational, but I also feel bad because a lot of our best workers have been quitting or transferring (we got cut hours and all that too). I’ve always been treated super well and given my best in return, so I will miss it, but it’s not the right place for me anymore. 

What can I do to overcome this anxiety? Is it really such a big deal to quit? 

Also, how much notice is plenty for retail- I want to make it easy for my managers?","Anxiety"
"1750587756","Possible cause of new or worsening anxiety and depression","I would like to share that if you are having new or worsening anxiety or depression, it is relevant to note that, according to many sources like on [Parathyroid.com](http://Parathyroid.com), high blood calcium, called hypercalcemia can be a cause. Of course there are many reasons a person can be anxious and/or depressed, but especially if these symptoms are new and there isn't a life reason you can identify, or, if you are already prone to anxiety and/or depression and it has become worse (sometimes much worse) for no reason you can really identify, please consider having your calcium and Parathyroid hormone levels checked. I say this because I am experiencing it and it is nearly intolerable. ","Anxiety"
"1750608898","Health anxiety","I worried I have a DVT. I have left leg pain that comes and goes. Mostly stays because I obsess over it. Really trying to avoid an ER trip considering I was there less than a month ago with a negative d-dimer. It’s really difficult to compare my calves because they are two different sizes due to muscle atrophy in my one leg because I have had surgeries years ago and a titanium rod in there (right leg). I do walk with a limp and put most of my weight on my left leg. I’m so exhausted from feeling this way.","Anxiety"
