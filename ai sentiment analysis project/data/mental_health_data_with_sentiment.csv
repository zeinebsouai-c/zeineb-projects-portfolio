1572360722,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.    We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.    Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.  *****  ###Summary###  **Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.**    ""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.  * **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.    * People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue.   * **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)    * In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.    *  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.  * If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression,depression,4792.0,0.13233957219251336
1744611968,"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.  -----  Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.  We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:  https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.  https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.  YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:  - People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact  - ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.  - Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.  - Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).  - Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression,depression,2483.0,0.007434640522875828

1750730462,I’m a dad. I want to commit suicide.,"I’m a dad to 3 amazing girls. I turned 30 in December, and lately, I just see no point to anything. I’ve always had that feeling creeping around me since childhood, but now, it’s taking over every thought.   I love my family, I love my wife, I love our cute little apartment that she decorated, I love my two best friends, I love our puppy, but I just don’t love myself.   I’ve been fighting often with my partner recently, I know I need to do more, be a better father, and a husband, but every time I make small steps towards bettering myself, it goes unnoticed and not appreciated. But why do I need appreciation? I don’t need it…but I want it, and I crave it.   Im the only breadwinner in the family, and while I don’t earn much, I’m proud of supporting my family everyday. I’m proud of the things I accomplished. But, I’ve lost my momentum, my enjoyment in life. I know we cannot be happy everyday. I think that’s a stupid goal. If we are happy everyday, it would lose its meaning I think. Some days are bad, some good. It’s life. But, I want to die. The only thing stopping me is breaking my family apart by doing something so selfish. I feel like I’ve died already on the inside. I’m writing this just so I have some place to vent. I’m scared. I’m sad. I’m broken. I’m a dad.   EDIT: Thank you all very very much for the support. A lot of these comments made me cry to be honest. I will be seeking help, and guidance. Every one of you are amazingly kind people. You all deserve the best. I am in no position to help, but if you need any, please reach out.

1750762807,Got ditched by a friend on a trip we planned together. I’m feeling worthless and alone.,"I don’t even know how to start, but I need to get this out. I (28M) planned a trip to Asia with two close friends (both 25M). We confirmed the plan months ago. I saved up and spent around €1000 on my plane ticket — something I wouldn’t have done if I wasn’t sure they were coming too.  One of them dropped out three weeks before my flight — said he couldn’t afford it. I was disappointed, but I understood. The second one was less straightforward. He kept dodging calls and being vague until eventually, right before my trip, he told me he was traveling with his siblings instead.  He apologized, said he “fucked up,” but never offered to help or suggest any alternative. Now I’m here, alone, feeling like I’ve been completely abandoned and disrespected. I even asked if he’d consider helping with my flight cost just as a gesture of accountability, and he said no.  I feel stupid for caring so much, for hoping this trip would be something meaningful. Instead I just feel used, thrown away, and honestly, pretty worthless. I know it's ""just a trip,"" but it really shook something in me. Like — am I that easy to drop? Do people not value me the way I value them?  I can’t stop overthinking it. My chest feels heavy all the time. I can’t sleep well. I feel completely empty.  I don’t want to lose the friendship because they are my only friends, but I also don’t know how to keep trusting someone who can do that.   Has anyone been through something like this? How do you move forward when something like this knocks your self-worth down so hard?

Nothing feels right to do, think, feel or say. My existence feels literally cursed to the very core and soul of my being. Every moment I experience is a chance for things to somehow get better finally which I hope for but it never happens.

I’ve been going through a similar phase for the past few months. I feel stuck in a loop I can’t break out of, and with time, things are only getting tighter and more difficult.  I’m a 28-year-old married man, with an 11-month-old son. Right now, I’m under a loan burden of around 2.45 million PKR, out of which 1.2 million is from the bank and the rest from friends. I’m grateful to have some really good friends who helped me in tough times. But now the loan amount has become so overwhelming that my head constantly feels heavy with stress.  As soon as my salary comes in, the bank installment of 40,000 PKR gets deducted. Then come household expenses and my baby’s needs. For the past few months, my salary barely lasts till the 15th or 20th of the month. Every month I have to borrow, sometimes from a friend and sometimes from somewhere else, just to get by. But now it feels like there’s no way out. Right now, I have only 1,000 rupees left in my account.  The biggest part is that I’ve never shared this situation with anyone not my family, not even my wife, and not even the friends who lent me money. Maybe I was afraid of being judged. Even when friends asked if everything was okay while giving me money, I would make up some excuse. But now, I’ve started getting disturbing thoughts, and I had read somewhere that sometimes just sharing what you’re going through helps. That’s why I’m writing this.  I don’t want sympathy. I just want to ask if there’s any way to come out of this trap. Any ideas for a side income, or a realistic approach I can follow?

1750800981,I'm 23 and I've wasted my life. Everything is over...,"So I'm 23 and I'm completely lost in life.   I was a semi decent student in school but i never had any talents. I wasn't very good at arts or sports neither. I never felt like I had an inclination or something.   I didn't manage to get accepted into a university, although I tried twice. I failed the entrance exams mainly because i used procrastinate everyday and i didn't know how to study correctly. I remember that i wouldn't start studying until midnight and then it would get too late. I still have sleep problems, i could never sleep ""early"" i always stay awake until late midnight. And I don't know if my brain is actually wired how it is supposed to in order to do OK academic stuff.   After failing to attend higher education i started working in a warehouse. I stayed there for 1 year but it was just a dead and job and it wouldn't get me anywhere. I thought that getting a trade could probably be the solution to ""finding a good job"" but i was wrong.   I'm physically weak and small and the construction site was hell. The tradesmen would get very mad and yell at me constantly (I have literally 0 spatial awareness). They'd say that i was too dumb for manual work and i didn't have the brains that were demanded for it. I got laid off after a while and i began feeling really overwhelmed and useless. I didn't know how to use the tools correctly. Whenever I had my hands on them it didn't feel right and I think I need more time than the average person to get a grasp of how things work.   I also don't have any close friends at all. Rarely anyone messages me and i usually stay at home everyday. I don't get social cues and I'm really awkward with people I don't know. I've been depressed and unemployed for a year now and it's terrible. It's just latestage alienation. I'm basically a NEET  I can see my parents disappointment on me which gets worse and worse everyday but i don't know how to get out of this situation.   I've been thinking for years that I might be autistic with ADHD but i was never diagnosed as a child and it's petty hard to get diagnosed here when you're an adult. I don't have any social skills at all and i suffer from general anxiety disorder and depression. I find it hard to complete simple tasks. For example i have my driving's license but i won't drive, I'm a terrible driver and sitting behind the wheel is something that my brain refuses to handle.   Could i possibly have learning disabilities or be borderline mentally retarded who's somewhat functional? Life's so hard. I feel like I'm genuinely trying but I can't make it.   My life is just dull and repetitive. I've completely lost track of time. I just wake up and wait till this day is over only to experience the same thing the next day. It's like groundhogs day, but with grey colors.  I see everyone being happy or making progress in their lives but im still 23 and stuck in the exact same place that every one was after high school. I feel like I've missed so much time and it's too late. All of my classmates from school have already graduated from uni and are trying to get their lives together while I'm still at 0.   The worst thing is that i don't have any interests or passions, I don't feel like anything is worth trying tbh. I also can't think of anything that I'd like to follow. Everything seems just boring and blunt. Plus i find it hard to understand complex subjects like Maths.

1750800973,I need some suggestions on how to cope with depression fatigue,"I think I have depression. I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety a few years ago with subclinical depression (the doc said it was not severe enough to be clinically considered a disorder). I started sertraline 50mg and it helped me a lot. I became very calm and my anxiety was gone. Fast forward a year and my doctor got me off the med tellling me I don't need it anymore.  That's been months ago, my anxiety has not come back but I am very tired.  I don't think it is likely that I'm having some sort of late withdarawal symptoms. I have been extrmely exhaused for a while now but it started weeks after stopping the med (I think). I am so tired like I could sleep all day. I literally have this kind of feeling that you get in your eyes when you are sleep deprived although I sleep enough. I don't even have any energy to think or to make decisions. I am just extremely tired. But I don't feel sad though ( I mean I do some times where i feel like I need to cry or yesterday I just had this anger in me like I just wanted to flip out and it was making me upset ) I feel more like some sort of apathy. Like I just can't be botehred to care, too exhaused for that.  I think this could be depression. It is kinda affecting my life right now becuase I am not doing the things I need to get done.  I will go visit my psychiatrist. But meanwhile do you have any tips to manage the fatigue? It really cannot go like this any further. I need to get it together.

1750798502,The end might be near,"Im (21M) so done. I don’t even know how to begin because there’s so much. I think I have been depressed for at least two years. And i feel like at a boiling point.  I have people who care for me and are there for me. Parents, lifelong best friends, a girlfriend. I am a creative person and I have found something to keep me occupied for a loooong time. And I find myself in a situation where I have all the tools to “succeed” but I don’t allow myself to. I know exactly what I need to do but I simply can’t.   I had a therapist last year but I quit because I’m extremely cynical. I don’t trust people, and in most cases, I don’t like people. I always deeply appreciate a genuinely good person tho, especially strangers, that really lifts me up. But if could choose my dream reality it would be one where I hardly have to interact with people outside of my inner circle. But yeah, I had a situation 5 years ago that made me paranoid and unable to open up to people. And so I couldn’t be fully honest because I felt like it would be used against me by the therapist . I didn’t tell him I have had suicidal thoughts (and intentions) for years because Im afraid I’d be placed on some institution or watch list for those kind of people. Not because they care, but because then I wouldn’t be their problem anymore. To preserve their career and/or consciousness.   So I never fully opened up about that very real problem. And I don’t either to those close to me. I dont open up about anything really. I don’t like people talking about other people. I find the way some people do it so, but so disgusting. I live in a small city, so I see it everywhere, people can’t help it. Even my own mother did that once and to this day I can’t bring myself to share anything with her. (Basically I asked her to not tell anyone that I have a girlfriend. Not because I don’t want people to know, but because, genuinely, people don’t need to know. It frustrates me how/when people don’t realize other dont NEED to know about anything. It’s okay to not say shit. People only want t know because they are curious and want to be able to bring tea to the table. I could continue with this for a while. But anyway, a guy I know told me “heard you have a girlfriend”, and this friend’s mother is really close to mine. Like a knife to the heart).   When it comes to really opening up to my girlfriend and my friends, who I love dearly… I just can’t. I don’t know why. They give no reason not to do it, im aware that’s it’s the perfect place to do so, but… The maximum I go to is make jokes about it, which I don’t know if they get noticed or not. I don’t know if I want them to be noticed or not.  I know they all want the best for me but they squeeze me and the only juice that comes out is the usual “everything is good, fine, downright perfect”. My parents bother me by how much they care.  I’m probably a case against emotional intelligence. And I am fully aware that I am my own worst enemy. All that goes wrong in my life does so because of my choices.   I’m suppose to graduate in a few weeks. I missed my final assignments which were due a week ago and I haven’t told a soul. But whenever someone asks I say all is going smooth. This means I won’t be able to graduate, and my parents and my gf parents are suppose to meet for the first time at the ceremony. And I already feel so fucking embarrassed that it won’t be possible because I couldn’t graduate.  I’m so done with this. With being me. And I’m not getting better. I don’t even know if, deep down, I want to get better. Because the only thing ahead is adulthood, and if college is suppose to be “the best years” and mine where sprinkled with depression, I can’t even imagine adulthood.  At this point, I feel the most inclined towards suicide than I ever had. I feel the most “intense” (I don’t how to describe it in any other way) in general. And that’s saying a lot because I don’t remember a day where I didn’t think about doing it. But it never felt so close as it does now.  I’ve thought about crashing this little car I bought recently into a tree or something. There’s a big road near me and that’s where I’d do it. But besides the thought of making the people close to me sad, hatred stops me from doing it.  Hate that my funeral would be filled with people who are there for the gossip and have nothing else to do. The old ladies who function as town cameras and microphones. I went to 3 funerals last year and all of them had these kind of people. In one of them there were people judging the fact that the husband was heavily mourning his recently deceased. At her funeral. Like wtf. They didn’t even knew him they were just because they had nothing else to do with their time. Ridiculous.   Imagine these people, plus the statistically probable idiots (cuz there’s always at least one everywhere) at a guy’s funeral who died of suicide. Honestly, it’s such a stupid obsession by a stupid, petty man, that I thought of purely making my suicide note “A funeral would be an insult to my memory. But in the likely event that outside pressure takes the best, no more than 10 people. And in the even more likely event that this is disrespected and ignored, my wish is for everyone to go and piss in my grave, because might as well do it literally too.”  I don’t know why I’m writing this here. I don’t really have a goal with this. Take care everyone, if this helps anyone via cautionary tale or something, that’s awesome :)",depression,depression,5466.0,0.09665941629176922

1750798327,"23F with MDD, struggling with binge eating and weight gain. Need advice on how to get back on track","Hi everyone, I'm a 23-year-old woman diagnosed with major depressive disorder. One of the biggest struggles I’ve been dealing with is binge eating. I'm currently on 187.5mg of venlafaxine daily. When I first started taking it, it actually helped reduce my binging episodes, but lately, it feels like I’ve lost control again. I’m bingeing regularly and it's making me gain weight rapidly and feel physically sick afterwards - not just emotionally but genuinely unwell in my body.  A couple of years ago, I used to be really into fitness. I was lifting 5x a week, felt strong, and was proud of my progress. But I haven’t properly worked out in over a year now. I’ve lost all my muscle and strength, and it’s hard not to feel ashamed or defeated when I compare myself to who I used to be.  I want to get back into working out, rebuild my strength, and lose the fat I’ve gained. Most importantly, I want to stop using food as a coping mechanism and have a healthier relationship with it again. But I honestly don’t know where to start - both mentally and physically. Every time I try, I feel overwhelmed or give in to old habits.  If anyone has been through something similar or has any advice - whether it's about managing binge eating, getting back into fitness after a long break, or just tips on where to begin again - I’d really appreciate it. I just want to feel like myself again.  Thank you in advance.",depression,depression,1406.0,0.09576465201465204

1750780861,I’m 3 semesters into my master's thesis and completely stuck (anxiety/depression/mental paralysis),"Hi, sorry if this is not the best sub for this post but I'm relatively new to reddit.  I'm 24 and I'm currently doing my master's thesis in the engineering field. To give some context, the program is structured so that the first three semesters are for coursework, and the fourth is for the thesis. I finished all my coursework on time, but I have now been working on my thesis for 3 semesters. My goal is to finish it this semester but I'm struggling so bad and don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure why I'm making this post tbh, I guess I'm looking for advice? Or maybe I just want to rant idk.  I always had good grades in school (always on honor's boards etc), but never considered myself smart. I was always very insecure (although I only realised this halfway through uni) and was always worried that teachers only gave me good grades because they liked me. I was never one to suck up to teachers or anything but they used to like me for being well behaved in class and having good grades. Although looking at it rationally, I'm sure that wasn't the case as my grades were consistent as I went through different teachers and different schools.  I used to love school before I went to high school but then I started struggling with anxiety (and I guess depression although I never got it diagnosed) and then I started hating going to school. I was praised for being quiet in class but I was always daydreaming and basically just mastered the art of pretending to pay attention. Despite that I maintained my grades. One thing to point out is I never really cared about having high grades myself, I was just scared of disappointing my father (who always wanted me to have excellent grades) and teachers. In 11th grade I had my first panic/anxiety attack and was medicated with antidepressants and ansiolitics but I never went to therapy (my mother tried to get me an appointment in a hospital but I think the waiting time was too long, and I didn't insist on it because I was terrified of talking to a stranger tbh). After that I pretty much had an anxiety attack every day which then got less frequent as I learnt to control it better. What fucked me up though was that I started having suicidal thoughts/suicidal ideation and began self harming (nothing too extreme really because I was terrified of getting caught, so it only lasted a few months).  I've always had suicidal thoughts since then but I knew I could never actually do it. A few things kept me from doing it, like me being an only child and my parents not being close to the rest of the family. I knew that if I were to die, they would probably end up divorcing and being alone (they never had that great of a relationship to begin with) and I could not bring myself to do that to them. Also, I was terrified of failing and ending up disabled. I did not have a plan or anything, I just wished I could die randomly or have the courage to kill myself. I used to fall asleep begging to not wake up and go to school begging to get in an accident somehow. This got way worse as I began my thesis though. Killing my self was everything I thought about. Suddenly I had a plan and spent two months only reading about it (this was last year in august-september). At some point I realised how serious it got and it actually scared me enough to get help (my university has therapists on campus and we can have appointments for free). However, I never told my therapist about the suicidal thoughts and only told her about struggling with finishing my thesis.  Some context about my path in uni: I wasn't feeling too bad in the 1st semester of the 1st year, my grades got lower compared to high school but I did not care tbh, I was just happy that my father was not strict with my grades anymore and that uni professors do not get close enough to us to create expectations. But then covid hit and we were sent home, I stopped taking my meds because I was terrified of going to get them as I was always afraid a doctor would tell me I did not ""deserve"" the meds for not having it bad enough. Well, being stuck at home and without meds I struggled a lot to study but managed to pass all my classes. Second year comes, still online, and I start struggling way more, cannot get myself to study at all but fail only 1 class. Third year was a mix of online and in person classes, but I still couldn't get myself to study and failed 3 more classes. Somehow in my fourth year (1st year of master's) I got a bit better and managed to finish all classes I had left behind from my bachelor's. Basically, I struggled a lot with getting myself to study for individual tests, although I always worked a lot when it came to group projects.  Going back to my thesis, I had a different topic in the 1st semester, which was very abstract and I had less support compared to now. At the end of that semester I had nowhere near enough work done so I decided to stay one more semester to finish my thesis (this was the august-september period I talked about). I continued getting nowhere with the topic (it made me so anxious I couldn't even work on it), so I ended up changing it to a more practical one but I only had two thirds of the semester left by then (december 2024 - march 2025), which was tight. But it was like I was reborn. I managed to work in my thesis everyday and I felt so much better, I still had suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday but I was able to push them back and not let it be everything I thought about. However, I was not able to turn in my thesis at the end of that semester because I didn't finish writing it in time (I only had like 40% written), so I enrolled for one more semester. That was almost 3 months ago and I've barely done anything since then (I don't even know how so much time has passed, it's like I don't remember the person I was 3 months ago or how I was able to do it). All I have to do is write now (besides one experiment I was told to do, but it's not anything big) but I just can't do it. It's like I'm back where I was before I changed topics. All I think about is dying again. I have visions of me shooting/stabbing myself constantly even when talking to other people. I will not bring this up to my therapist as I'm terrified of my parents finding about this. Everyday I come to uni but I just can't do anything. I'm just so tired of being like this... but apparently not enough to actually change anything.  I never had any dreams or ambitions. My only dream was dying (sounds corny af but honestly it's the truth, there was never anything I wanted more than that). When I was in high school I was convinced I would die before getting to uni. When I got to uni I was convinced I would die before getting to the thesis part. I never believed I would ever be able to do a thesis, I always thought I'm not smart enough (people always tell me well if everyone can do it you can do it too, but right now I'm just showing myself I was right tbh). I never loved my degree, but doing nothing wasn't an option and I had to study something so I just went with it. Me not having any goals in life certainly does not help my situation at all. I wish I could be passionate about something, but I've always been very apathetic in general, I've never had strong opinions about anything. Very little can get a big reaction out of me tbh.  Dealing with people is another problem. Last year I would cry every sunday night just thinking about having to go to uni the next morning. One day of the week I would go to my supervisor's place of work, and I would cry the night before and I'd be fighting tears on my way there. Having lunch with the group of investigators/phd students/master's students both there and in uni was a nightmare, which rationally is so stupid, how can I struggle so much with just lunch? Like my hands would shake, my jaw would shake, my eyes would tear up, I was always hyperaware of the way I was holding my knife and fork or the way I chewed, I never talked, I would always try to stay close to a friend that was also here at the time and avoid the others. I was always jealous of the ease with which others would make small talk, I wish I could be that easy going.  It was exactly the same when I was working on my thesis around everyone. Always hyperaware of people walking in the corridor, doors closing, people going in and out of the room. I'd jump at the slightest noise. It was absolutely exhausting. I was constantly in a state of anxiety, staring at the clock waiting for it to be time to go home. Then I'd feel immense relief for a few hours until the dread of coming back the next day set in again. Nowadays I'm not as anxious being here but it still messes with me a bit. And it's so frustrating to think that it took me over a year to become somewhat more comfortable around these people even though they're super nice.  I feel like I make my life miserable for no reason. I'm lucky enough that my parents support me financially and never wanted me to move out. My parents aren't rich by any means but I've always had a very privileged life as I've never had to worry about going hungry, having a roof over my head or paying bills. And I feel like I'm abusing that privilege. If I had to fend for myself I'd have no other choice but to grow the fuck up right?  I feel bad for anyone that has ever believed in me. I feel like lots of people thought I would be somewhart successful in life and if I were to meet them again they would wonder how the hell I ended up like this. But my fear of disappointment does not push me to work harder, it just paralyses me. I honestly don't understand how I would rather do nothing and suffer like this than just take action and finish this fucking thesis. And I'm not even thinking about the shit show that will be looking for a job, I can't even imagine that tbh. I literally just wanted to graduate.  Dropping out can't be an option at this point. I have to suck it up and just do it. I've tried making to do lists with super small tasks but it's still daunting. My supervisor has tried giving me deadlines but I keep missing them (which I know is super disrespectful, even though he never tells me off). I've tried body doubling but it doesn't help either. I even tried slapping myself to get me to do something, anything really. But my brain just avoids avoids avoids. Every little things paralyses me. I feel this thightness on my chest and almost like a sense of doom whenever I even think about working on my thesis. I don't know how to ""just start"" either bc even when I manage to do that it's so hard to keep focused. I literally don't know how the hell I was able to do it early this year.  I also don't feel confident at all about the work I've done, I just feel like I'm not capable of doing anything good enough for a thesis.  At the end of the day, I recognise I'm just lazy and irresponsible. All I do is make excuses. Anyway, sorry for the way too long post, I'm sure it's all over the place as I've been writing it for almost 2 months now. I'm just tired of being like this tbh.",depression,depression,11051.0,0.045334916966272884

1750705995,I have the strangest kind of depression i've ever seen and i don't know what to do.,"I'm sorry if i sound pretentious.  I feel a pain inside me that’s hard to describe in words, but I can’t express it visually either.  When I say ""hard,"" I mean: I’ve never been able to articulate this pain to anyone.    Every time I try, I sound stupid—like a spoiled child making up a reason to be sad. But this pain is strange, unusual, and so deep.    The closest thing I can compare it to is feeling an overwhelming nostalgia for some other, inner world that I’ve almost entirely forgotten.    And not just nostalgia—the kind that makes it impossible to live. I can’t immerse myself in any fiction because it doesn’t match this vision.    I’ve searched for so long... I was convinced it must be some book I forgot. But such a book DOES NOT EXIST. Every time I try to sit down and write it, I’m too afraid. Afraid that if I write the first few words, it won’t be *it.* And this has happened so many times already.    Antidepressants don’t help. I can’t stop thinking about it, and every moment spent without this world drags me deeper into darkness.    I can’t enjoy anything. Everything has lost its flavor and color because it’s not THAT.  I don’t know how to go on living.    Sometimes I see fragments, scenes—I feel like they belong THERE—but when I try to add to them, it’s not right. They’re so fleeting. If I think about them the wrong way, or too much, they lose all their color but gain meaning.    It’s always burdened by this limitation. Every time I try to put it into words, it slips away.

Got me involuntarily committed, which is humiliating, I'm from a family of successful well-adjusted people who've been good to me and, idk, guess I thought I'd figure it out too at some point.   Hard to see that happening now, I don't have any real convictions about anything, except I think my fundamentalist religious upbringing may have done a number on me, and the world is too screwed up and confusing for me to know if I'm adding any value by sticking around. Had SI since maybe age 15, and it's been bad for like 9-10 years or so.

1750785967,My whole life story and years of therapy that did not work,"Due to anger, sadness and despair I feel the urge to post about my situation online, so I am picking the vent / rent tag for this post.  I think it's best for this post if I start by telling you my story and my background before I rant about the current situation of therapy failing me or me failing therapy.  I am male, 27, from a middle european country with both my parents being born in the balkan. I don't know much about my parents early life as I don't talk that much with them and never really used to. Before the war in ex- jugoslawia really started, my parents moved to middle europe. My mum was younger than me when she moved to the new country and started illegaly working to finance life until she received the permission to work legally. She has told me some stories and it was a rough time for her. It was hard work and she was treated quite badly by the employer. Her father, my grandpa, has worked there some years before her and he was treated bad too. Mom was just about 26 when she received me as her first of two children. My father was 37 at that time, so he is much older. Recently I have digitalized some old VHS recordings and while watching them is hard, like emotionally REALLY hard for me, I have noticed that we did not possess many items at home in our early days as a family. My father used to work as a truck driver in my early days and he claims he got diabetes from that job. Later on he worked on construction sites and due to health problems he now works for a factory. Apparently I was told by him, my mom and other relatives that he was a real good student back then and he started studying mechanical engineering as he was amazing at math. My father's family has quite a strong academic background. My mom's side is from rather rural area and it was peak when someone even finished school. Due to back problems and the upcoming war, he never finished his studies. I can imagine he hated all the jobs he had. I know he hates his current job he's doing for over a decade now.  I remember my **father** having sometimes **drinking** or rather **anger issues**. What I mean by that is he would start drinking after a conflict he created. I have a deep memory of my grandpa (mom's father) telling me that he was kicked out of the house by my father for apparently no reason and they didn't meet or talk to each other for years. I know my grandpa did nothing wrong. He got in conflict with my mom too. I don't really remember the arguments in detail but I know that my mom and me sometimes had to leave home at night, basically fleeing from him as he would hit her. One of those nights I remember clearly. We would run from he with my little sister in the stroller. It was a cold winter night, it was snowing and we hid in squatting position with paranoia of seeing him in cars that drove by. I don't remember being hit in those arguments, as it was more about my mom and him. I was ""just"" watching and crying. I remember being hit by both of them if I messed up as a kid (e.g. Had a couch and I was drawing on paper with a pencil on that couch and unfortunately made holes in that couch). And later on I was hit because of my school performance. Last time I was hit really was maybe at the age of 13 or 14.  Let's move on to **kindergarten** and **primary school**. I was really scared of the kindergarten idea. I've cried and begged for my mother to not drop me off there. I've probably also had a hard time understanding the foreign language as my parents only tought me their native language. I did not have many friends at the kindergarten. I've had one good friend though, he was from turkish descent. I don't have many memories of kindergarten. I think that time was okayish. Before primary school there was a test that tells if your child should go to pre school or primary school. I remember the test being really hard. They made me draw the number 8 and I probably didn't even know what that was. They gave me the starting point for the 8 and when I've drawn up to the crossing point, I was looking both, my mother and the instructor, for help because I did not know if I should take the section of the 8 to the right (wrong) or to the left to complete the loop (right). I've failed that. Also they made me repeat a tongue twister and obviously I did not do well as a foreign speaker. So I've failed the test but there was a second chance for it and I've made it next time. But I remember my mom being really angry about it and screaming at me. I've had to do all sort of excercises with her which I did not enjoy especially with her being moody. Primary school was quite enjoyable for me. The kindergarten friend ended in the same class as me, which was nice. I've befriended a few more class mates but we never really hung out after school. After school was boring for me. I've hated doing homework and all I've really did was watching TV. Both my parents worked full time iirc and my aunt or grandma would keep an eye on me and my sister, who is about 2.5 years younger than me. I barely remember going outside at this time of my life. At some point I was going to the training of the local football/soccer club. I was really bad at it and the coach didn't really let me play, which created a conflict between my father and the coach. Also I didn't make any friends there. I've dropped it after a time, but I think I was there for a year or two. I've had no after school friends and only sometimes would we visit a local playground, which often times was empty and if there were children I did not have any contact with them. At least that's what I remember. I also remember crying in school at one time because the friends that I've had didn't really bother with me anymore. Fortunately that didn't last long. Also I remember crying deeply and being unable to talk to my teacher because I was having issues with breathing. This was due to bad school performance and the fear of going home to tell my parents. Also it felt like I was disappointing my parents. My parents really wanted me to attend grammer school (which is for kids with best grades) therefore they were strict. Ironically they never helped me with any home work or learning or scheduling my day. I've had to do all that by myself, which basically ended in me doing the bare minimum, so only the homework. I've never studied for a single exam in primary school except for some math exams with my father. Those were hard hours with many tears. He made me do math problems for so many hours and he would get angry if I made a mistake. At the end of primary school, I've had decent grades and was able to attend grammar school.  So next is **grammar school / high school.** We moved before grammar school started and sometimes I was forced by my parents to leave the house and go to the local playground with my sister. I think it took a few times going out until I've befriended children my age at the playground. That was the time in my life I've had the most friends. I remember being really popular in my neighbourhood. Everyone thought I was funny and we really laughed so much together it was great. There it was where I fell in love for the first time. It was the girl next door and we had an on-off thing. Remember I was maybe 12 at that time. At the age of 13 or so many girls wanted to be my girlfriend and I've literally could have chosen and did so. My neighbourhood friends and me had a football/soccer phase and luckily there was a place to play nearby. I was still really bad. Probably because I did not do much sports. But this time I've enjoyed playing and I was able to play. No one told me you can't play like the coach did years earlier. My grades even in the first year of grammer school / high school fell off, which is quite normal as it is harder than primary school. I've went from mainly A to C grades. Still I was only doing homework, even less times than in primary school and did not study at all. I've made 3 friends in my class. We've always stayed the same friend group until school split our paths. We also hung up after school. I think I was happy at that time. I've had friends, did sports, enjoyed gaming (early runescape!) and sometimes school was interesting for me. Then in 7th grade I really fell off with my school performance. I did not even write any notes in school, no homework, no studying. Maybe it was puberty, maybe it was other things more interesting at that time - I don't really know. But I've had to repeat 7th grade. And I think that was a crucial situation and maybe the stress of my life. I was lying all the time to my parents that my grades are okay and I was faking their signature for test results, but eventually they find it out, obviously. It was the fear that made me do all those things. After a bad test result I did not go home after school but accompany my class mates to their place because I've had to talk with them about my situation and create a plan on how to hide the result from my parents. I was definitely hit at this time of my life because of the lying and the bad grades. They would hit me with a belt and I even had to pick it from the closet and bring it to them. When I picked a softer belt they would tell me to go back and bring a proper one. sometimes i was even hit with the metal buckle of the belt. For most times they spared my head. Only when I was blocking my butt or legs with my hands they would hit me head so me hands move away. At that time I also stuffed my pants with toilet papier in preparation to the beating. They also used their bare hands to hit me. I was never hit with a fist. I was lifted by my hair from the ground and when I got a hair cut my father said unfortunately he can't do that anymore. I was forced to stay inside as a punishment to my grades. I've lost all of my friends except for those at school, but I did not have a chance to meet them after school anymore. Also I was deeply in shame because I've failed the class and did not want my neighbourhood friends to find out. I was the only one attending the grammar school and they had high hopes for me, I did not want to fail them also. At that time I spoke to a teacher and told that my parents are beating me because of the bad grades. I have showed my class mates my bruises on my butt and legs. The teacher advised me to the school's psychologist. Once I've told her everything she invited me father to join us. She confronted my father with the beating allegation and he assured her that he was not going to beat me. I do not remember anymore if that helped or not. If all the beating has already happened at this point because he already knew my grades and the lies or if he really stopped. I do remember being beaten occassianally way later. Also it was this year when I was drinking alcohol for the first time. A friend did steal hard liquor, but he was so drunk that his mother obviously noticed and they went to police. At the police station this friend told the police that I was also involved and drinking. So I had to go to police with my mom and tell the story. I did not receive any punishment from police as I was just 13. But my mom did the punishment of course. My father was rather chill about it as he did similar things in his youth.  Now I have to repeat 7th grade. I've managed to pass this grade, but my grades were not great especially if you consider that I'm repeating it. To not disappoint my parents I have faked my school report. And when my mom went to a teacher they found out about it and I was beaten again. She also found out that I skipped school and played basketball instead with other class mates. Or when an exam was up I would just skip the day of school. Beside skipping school with friends I did not meet any of the friends after school.  8th grade I had good grades, B level overall. Especially in math I was doing amazing, scoring almost always 100% of possible points. I did study at school during classes for exams which really worked out as I'd study several hours by doing so. Still I did not meet any friends after school, but now I've had one class mate with whom I'd play video games on PC and talk to via skype. This gaming relationship lasted for a few years, which was great. At the end of this grade we had the chance to pick another school which take 5 years of A levels or go with this school and do it in another 4 years. I liked the idea of another school, because it was mainly IT themed and I've had interestes in that as a large part of my life after school was in front of a computer. My parents were against it because it was out of town and like 50 minutes via train. I bought their argument and stayed at the same school. The next years very quite boring. I was mostly at home at the computer watching youtube, playing games and later on just doing...nothing? I was switching between browser tabs as I was not motivated to do anything. I have missed many things a teen probably should do. Like the first ""real"" love, not those relationships as a child, going out on weekends, on parties, drinking, living your own life, being independent of your parents etc. . I have missed all of these events, because I did not really have friends. Most class mates liked me, but we were not friends. Some did invite me to parties etc. but I was not allowed to attend these or at least not allowed to stay late or get drunk. So I declined every time and after a while they didn't bother anymore asking me. 11th grade or so I became friends with some of my class mates and we hung out, but still I didn't attend any parties or group events and so I didn't meet any new people. This is probably the year I watched a lot of physics and science videos and got hooked on it. The school I was attending was also heavily science focused, we had a lot of chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics. The idea of becoming a physicist, maybe astrophysicist, came across. Dropping the old idea of going into IT. It was also this year that I fell in love with a girl I've seen at an event. Our glances met and I've immediately felt something. I have noticed that she and her friend wanted to talk to me, but they didn't dare. We were a group of 3 boys. Neither did I dare. After the event, I searched on facebook for a group of that event and made a post that I was looking for a certain girl. And her friend did find it and we got in contact. It felt like a coincidence which was not meant to be a coincidence. We had contact for a while but she did not want any relationship and always had excuses for not making it to the date. It kinda broke my heart. I also had an existential crisis at that point, because I've felt that everything is without meaning...Love is not real, it's just chemicals, the universe is deterministic and we have no free will, the universe will ""die"" at some point, global warming etc. . This is the first time I was suicidal. I knew my life was not great for years, alone in my dark room in front of the pc, missing life and everything it contains, but I was never thinking about ending my life before. I was even rationalising the idea of suicide. ""Doing it now will prevent good things and bad things, but once you're dead you can't mourn for the good things. So it's just rational"", this is what I said at that time.  Unfortunately I've never completed this text.",depression,depression,15317.0,0.04646357003211842
1750764251,My dad makes me want to take my own life,"I’m 20 years old, studying college. For my entire life my dad was a toxic abusive person towards us. My mom, sister, and I endured his anger issues, abusiveness, and impatience for as long as I can remember. He was barely present my entire childhood, but everytime he went home he would just shout at us, or sometimes even hurt us.   As the years went by, he’s gotten softer. But he never regreted his actions before and for that I never forgave him. He still ocassionally acts and speaks abusively. He holds me back from everything I love. My passion, my hobbies, and things that make me happy. He makes me miserable. I wanna end it. My dad is the only major problem I have in life.

For getting a place to a therapist, it’s necessary to apply countless times first, then if I’m lucky I’ll be taken, but have to wait several months first. If it becomes more urgent to the point that I need to an in-patient clinic, they don’t just take the referral from a doctor, they want a full current psychological report, which, if you don’t have a current therapist, you don’t have. Then you have to go to a psychiatric clinic and ask for help from doctors there, that they diagnose and refer you and write you that report(at least it’s this way in my country, don’t know if it’s the same for everyone else). But when calling all, even the biggest clinics in town, they either say they have no appointments left, or the next one is in a few months. Not to mention that places at inpatient clinics take even longer to get, few months minimum. I’m so sick of this. Why do I have to do and wait so much just to get the help I need.

I constantly live in my head in a world where my life went the way it should’ve…I graduated from school, got a nice job, provided for my mum and sister, got a partner who loved me for me, married and travelled the world.   I can’t even begin to explore the amount of traumatic events I’ve experienced, but I just hate how slow time is passing. Whenever I spend too much time alone I spiral and cry so I have to rely on calling someone every day to cope and not think too much about reality.  I’m not really sure what the point of this post was…I just wanted to get it off my chest",depression,depression,1249.0,0.16898395721925136
1750774040,Just want to vent about How I feel for abit.,"From the beginning of my life, I have had great expectations placed on me. My family is a broken shell that looks well from the outside. From my childhood, I had a better learning capacity from my peers. I still have. I can learn a topic for 3-6 mins and accurately keep the knowledge planted in me. It was something even my parent's knew and had reasonable pride on. I lived a pretty average life during my childhood. I was a victim of being bullied during 4th year. It got so bad that it affected my studies, back then they didn't have cctvs placed in classrooms. My parents apparently were told I was the problem child because I was the one getting bullied in the first place. After the 4th year finals, I was told that I had failed a few subjects and my parents had to meet with the faculty to decide my promotion to the 5th year. My father went to the meeting. For context, my father was a rather meritorious individual. He was a doctor who majored in medicine and after retirement started a textile company. After the meeting, my father was furious at me and telling my mother things like he didn't even pass a single subject. It was a rather heartbreaking day for me. I learned a few months ago that he didn't even go to the meeting because he simply feel ashamed. This led to my first attempt on myself, A lot of things raced across my mind. In the end, my reasoning for not offing myself was that I was angry. I was angry at myself,my parents and the world. If I died, my anger would die with me. Here I think the son that my parents had loved had died, I lived only due to their son's anger and hatred. My repeat year was a point of rehabilitation for me. I was aggressive and wary of the environment around me. I didn't trust my teachers who ignored my need for intervention and I didn't trust the students because they might be out for me. I remember punching a guy because I thought he was out for me. He didn't retaliate. He simply asked if I was ok. I apologised for punching him. It was a moment I realised I could trust others and that not everyone was out for me.   Life continued like usual for me. I was studying and continued my life, my grades were slowly improving things were going back to how it was. My parent continued to berate me for repeating a year. My family wasn't all that bad back then, my sister was born and alot of the expectation and stuff was reduced from me. I found friends. I was doing better. Seeing my improvement, my parents were happy. My parents started to intervene in my studies. My mother decided to put me in different academic lessons for school. It was as if my grades improving was all she could have wanted. My father told me he would buy me laptop. It was something we had no problem affording. My father's company was a pretty large scale one which he ran with his brothers. He told me I would get it if I got As in my grades for the next exam. When I did, he kinda evaded me. He continued these false promises until my GCSEs. My stress at its peak with my mother's countless lessons and the futility from my father's promises, My results essentially tanked. I averaged a score of 6.2. Afterwards my family was disappointed in me. They didn't say it out right but they had a way of expressing it with saying it knowing that it woulf be held against them. Now I am at year 11. My studies not that well. Whenever I study my mother now acts all nice like she wouldn't If I wasn't. Things like feeding me snacks or patting my hair, as if to train a pavlovian instinct. I have grown rather hateful of my family. Sometime back I got into an argument my father cuz I noticed he was berating and scolding my sister like he did me. Now my mother calls me the unfilial son who ruined this family. I can't stand being near my parents, I get these sudden fits of rage when I do. Only time was when I got into an argument my father, I don't want my sister to feel the same way I did growing up. I have decided to isolate myself from my family. If these feelings of rage become too bad and I do something, I intend on seeking professional help.",depression,depression,4088.0,-0.03282312925170066

Evrerything is incoherent in my head, i cant seem to hold any thoughts.   I keep messing up at work; they talk about firing me. It'll cost me an extra year as im working as an intern as part of my last polytechnic school year.   The company's past three interns were my friends. They talk about how easygoing it was, and how nice and friendlh the people were. But as I begin my 14th week of internship, i have to wonder. Am I that incompetent, so dislikable, so fat, ugly and unsociable? Why do they hate me when they liked them? I thought I was sociable and enjoyed speaking to people  . Now I skip out lunch and fight off hunger just to not speak with people. The worst part is my coworkers for the most part seem to be decently good people. In other words, its my fault, not them. I keep fucking up sinple shit and forget things. My friends tell me I do a lot of work compared to them; i want to belive that. i want to think im doing so much more that it overwhelms me amd causes me to make mistakes. but the truth is im just so retarded the work is not even that hard my brain is so foggy, i just want to go home all the time, i dont want to do work i want to slack off,  i just make so many mistakes. i dont want to take time to ensure i do good work i just want get it done the fuck with, so i can go home and do nothing and go to bed and rpeeat the same fucking cycle for god knows how fucking long. i thiught this field was my passion. i told myawlf and others that i dont have many interests; that this would be the closest it could be to that.  but i dont even have that now. i have no long term goals ever. maybe when i was 7 or something..ive always had that persistent feeling that this wasnt the life i wanted it to be. now i listen to peaceful ghibli music all day and let my imagination wander. im not at my office being whispered and laughed at behind my back. i'm somewhere in my mind where they cant hurt me.   recently ive started acknowledging that maybe i have some issues with depression. i thought intiially that i was just a little sad, that calling it depression would be insulting to those with actual issues. but i dont know what else to call these feelings.   my mind is deteroriating so badly. i used to like writing. use nice fancy adjectives. fuck that i cant even think of what words to type anymore. so much fog. so much MEMORY LOSS. its like the past 20 years of my life disappeared. everytime i try to recall it feels like so vague; so unclear, i cant picture it i just get a vague sense of emotion  im so obese. im 180cm and 120kg. i come home and binge and binge and binge and binge i dont even want to eat with others but recently you know it hasnt been on my mind lately. i tink i dont really care anymore.  there is noone i trust in my family they love me i know they do i love them too but i cant tell them anything. they will use it against me in countless i told you sos and its not so bads  my friends listem to me out of courtesy and  i dont even know what else to type naymore. i have work in 3 hours and ill just stau up. im scared of pain and death but recently permanent sleep hasnt sounded tko bad.",depression,depression,3247.0,-0.0696212121212121

I don't need basic 'advice'. I need more than advice that doesn't help.

I stress eat, or I don't eat cause I'm 'fat', and have to lower my weight, but I find it near impossible to do without injury, not even self harm injury. football?

To make things worse an incident took place last year, (i had a mental breakdown) i was arrested and sentenced this year and now my freedom is restricted because i have to wear a tag and i have a curfew, i hate it.     Now i am worried i have ruined my chances of going o different countries because of having a record, I'm upset with myself but i am more pissed off because i doesn't matter what i do to try and improve my life things just stay the same and the world around me just gets more and more dark the more i look at it.     The only thing that has helped me (a little bit) is music and taking my medication for depression, i just want to sleep now, i want to have more dreams where i don't have to think about my reality, i used to have enthusiasm, i used to be happy and i used to care more about life but i just don't now.",depression,depression,1730.0,0.008527846027845995

The idea of dealing with people makes me very anxious.   I feel like a loser. I used to be successful in my studies and jobs.   The only thing that is keeping me alive is my faith in Allah. I know my life is a test and everyone has hardships. But my parents are getting older. I am unable to take care of myself and I should be the one to take care of them. I am broke. If anything happens to my parents I will be alone and no source of income. I don't know what to do anymore. My dad told me a week ago that I have given up, I don't know if it's giving up or accepting who I am.  Has anyone been through this and managed to find away to get out. To find some project to work on for a living?   I tried therapy and meds for many years. They seem to work for sometime but then I spiral back into my old self. It did help me in understanding how my emotions work and how to deal with it so it's not  as hard as before. I can't afford them anymore. The living situation in Egypt is pushing my family away from middle class, same as every family in Egypt.

They are very painful and I feel every pain. It was out of control to the point I was scared to sleep.  I hate how I look. Im a male and I get jealous when I see girls and how pretty they are. And hate myself even more when I see handsome boys. I'm so ashamed to take pictures of myself.  I hate my personality, I see my old friends have alot of new friends and very popular. And here I am, I have literally zero friends. Only two cousins who speak with me at family occasions.  I hate my country. I'm born in sri lanka, I hate how people say racist things about my country. Telling that it's just another India. The creeps in South asia ruined the whole reputation.  I HATE MY MOM. She ruined my whole life. So many times I was about to kill myself because of her. She made me mentally so ill. She yells at me for imaginary things. She blackmails me. She is the most evil person I've ever known. I begged my other family members (grandma) to help, she is trying her best but nothing is working. I'm the eldest and I need to take care of my sister. I can't take it anymore.  I hate how I can't study anymore. I had alot of potential. Many teachers told me how sure they are about me getting into a university. And here I am, I barely passed the exam and couldn't go to uni. I'm so stuck.  I HATE MY LUST. Human interactions were very rare for me. The last time I spoke with a girl was on 2014. Now I'm 20 and haven't spoken any girl other than my sister and a female cousin. I HATE HATE how I get feelings for that cousin. I don't even masturbate much, maybe only three/four time a week. Some weeks only twice.  I hate how I can't go on without meds. The moment I get better using meds, mom makes it worse. Then I need to buy again. I've been using meds for more than 4 years and it's fucking me up. I can't do this shit.  My mom ruined my life. I have no one now. Dad left us, because of mom. Grandpa died, because of mom. Grandma doesn't want to live with us, because of mom. I got mentally ill, because of my mom. I'm afraid my sis will become ill, because of mom.  Moving away isn't an option because sis won't come and I can't take care of her. I can't just leave her here. Also, I NEED to study, but I can't bring myself to. I've lost the motivation. Moving away means I'm giving up on studies and that scares me. I want to improve my life. I want to be happy. I want to make my sister and dad happy.",depression,depression,2530.0,-0.07304132231404957

I have this supportive spiritual community, but I feel like I don’t want to vent to them, because my problems are stupid and I stopped doing all the spiritual stuff tgat helped me.

I’m starting teachers college in the fall and it took me a while to figure out what I was passionate about. A few years back, I was kicked out of a program because I was struggling with a death of a family member and due to this, I was unable to perform to their standards. No one seemed to understand the pain I was enduring and showing up to placement 3 days after his death before the funeral even happened. No one understood how hard it was. I was put in a different hospital to do my placement for x ray and a few weeks in, the people supervising me decided I didn’t have what it takes to move forward. They even said “ oh she doesn’t like learning” like I’m sorry I’m grieving and still showing up every fucking day. That takes strength, doesn’t it?   Now I’m on a different path and I know I should be happy that I found something that I’m passionate and good at, but a part of me will never forget the heartbreak I endured. I also get treated so shit by my family and no one gets it. I get asked “ are you gonna throw a tantrum” or things like that when I’m clearly upset.

I made a post on a different subreddit but I only got one reply. Maybe this post will help.  I've been diagnosed with clinical depression for about two months now. I was having such bad suicidal thoughts and my depression episodes leave me not being able to function in my daily life. I've had signs of depression and wanted to die since I was 11. Im now 19 and have barely been diagnosed. My parents never took my depression seriously so I was in denial of having anything wrong with me for many years. It took my boyfriend telling me to seek professional help before he looses me.  I've been in talk therapy for about 2-3 months now. It's helped on a little. The issue is I'm scared my depression is getting worse. I can't get out of bed, I can't feel joy, I can't take care of myself. Everyday I feel myself falling further and further into my depression. I'm so scared I'll never feel true happiness. My boyfriend is so worried. The only way I used to cope was through self harm but have been clean since 2021. The urges have been stronger since. But I can't. It's the only thing I can actually do right lately.  My therapist recommended antidepressants cuz she's affair I may be so far into my depression therapy may not help much for me. I'm so scared. I don't want to get worse but I'm afraid antidepressants won't work. My family member got addicted and I don't want to be addicted as well. I've dealt with eating disorders too and gaining weight is the most common side effect.  I feel so alone and empty.

1750749129,Just venting I guess,"21M  Im okay with no responses, I just need somewhere to put my thoughts in a place other people will at least see, because i don’t have the strength to talk about my feelings with friends or family. And this rant isn’t going to make any sense, i know it’s all over the place, you don’t need to read it all.  I’ve have Recurrent major depressive disorder for the past 10 years now. Something little triggered another episode a couple days ago, like something little always does. Some friends went to a book store without me, when we usually all go together, because I recently expressed I didn’t have much money, they assumed I wouldn’t want to go. I did, i’ve been stuck in this house, just rotting for the past few days. I feel so so emotional, I cry over the smallest things, I get so angry at people I love over the smallest things and it drives me insane, because I know i’m not enjoyable to be around. I feel so suicidal but I just cant do anything about it, I mean it’s been 10 years and I still haven’t committed even though I really want to.   I always wish, just someone would notice, that I withdraw from people even a little bit when I have an episode because it’s so. fucking. lonely. I don’t feel like myself. And i hate it. I’m probably going to feel this way for the next 2 weeks before the episode is over and I start to feel normal again.  You know what makes it so fucking annoying, is I can’t even bring myself to take my medication that help stop these episodes, I feel so stupid, I can’t even order more now, because I threw the last bottle out, out of fear of killing myself with it. 6 months ago, for the first time in about 9 years i worked up the courage to tell my mom i feel suicidal. We went to the hospital and they did nothing for me, talked to me, said I could do group therapy if i wanted, and then sent me home. I can’t get an appointment with my doctor to ask about more medicine because they don’t have appointments until 4 more months. I can’t get a therapist because no one takes my insurance and i have too much anxiety to do fucking anything with my life.   Sometimes I try to starve myself, I’ve gone sometimes over a week without eating because i’m too much of a coward to do anything else. I’m sobbing right now and i really, really just want to get in my car, and drive off a cliff somewhere, but I won’t be able to do it. I have a loving mother, and five little siblings who I know would miss me. I just don’t know what to do at this point.   Sometimes I have panic attacks that last hours, the last one I had, was in the middle of the night, and I was hyperventilating for over 30 minutes, it hurt so bad, I thought and hoped that I would just die from it.   My friends are also depressed, at least that’s what I infer. We never really openly talk about it, they don’t. I’ve never said a word about my mental health, and we’ve been friends for 10 years now. I’m scared they won’t care, I know they won’t know what to say. I always feel guilty when they text loving things in the group chat to each other like, good morning texts, get well soons, or console each other with nice words, I never can bring myself to also say nice things and I don’t know why. I don’t know how to word things, I don’t know how to say what I mean. When I do love them, i want to say i love you, but my mind just won’t let me and I don’t understand why.  I did a pre-construction program and graduated a month ago, and still haven’t brought myself to apply for new jobs. I feel useless, it’s something so simple, yet i won’t do it, i don’t know why. I only have enough money for one more month of bills and I just can’t anymore.   I feel like i’ve been crying for the past few hours.",depression,depression,3706.0,-0.01716033966033965

It instantly jumps to the darkest, most intrusive thoughts things like self-harm or even suicide. It’s exhausting. But I don’t tell them any of this. Why would I? What good would it do?  I know that if I opened up about the mental battles I’m facing, they’d talk about it behind my back the moment I’m not around. Maybe a few would show sympathy, but I know others would just say things like, “It’s all in your head,” or “Just think positive,” as if it were that simple.  So, sorry if I seem slow or out of it sometimes if I always look like I’m spaced out. It’s just... draining. And honestly, it’s getting exhausting being friends with people who notice every little thing I do but never stop to ask why.  It’s incredibly draining and tiring. If I only had the strength and courage to leave the group, I would’ve done it a long time ago. But I already know that if I did, you’d still find something bad to say about me. That’s what you’re good at pointing out other people’s flaws without ever looking at your own. You’re so insensitive.  Sometimes I wonder should I just be like you? Should I stop getting upset or sensitive whenever you constantly tease me? Maybe I’m the problem for being too easily affected. But if you're always the one being picked on, over and over again, wouldn’t you eventually get fed up too?  Don’t you ever stop to think that maybe you’re going too far? That it’s becoming really uncomfortable?  Honestly, you’re just adding more weight to the damage in my mental health. And sometimes, I start to think that maybe I’m the one who’s wrong. I begin to invalidate what I’m feeling because when you’re the ones being teased, you just laugh it off. But when it’s me, I react quickly, I get upset.

My sweet boys keep me here and I’m so heart broken and feel selfish for wanting to leave them.   My heart aches to stop, so that I’m no longer here, but I know in doing so my boys and husband would never be the same.   They would be broken, lost and confused. I want to be selfish so badly. But I can’t for them.   The pain is so overwhelming, and I hate as I type and cry my youngest who loves me the most is begging for attention.

It all changed almost 3-4 months ago, it almost feels like every bad thing that could happen just happened. They lost a friend to suicide, their dog had very scary medical emergencies, lost their job, a lot of hospitals visits it almost felt like their body is falling apart and family issues.  Still no luck with the job part, they just seem hollow now overall, after some convincing and arguing I got them to do therapy as their mom was open to pay for it since even she noticed they were not well.  It’s been a month on therapy now and I can see the smallest baby steps forward, nothing major but now they can have 3 okay days in the week instead of 0, which is a big improvement in my book.

I guess the only thing that can sometimes work is space, like leaving them alone for a few hours, but even that can fail sometimes, I tried morning and night messages, simple ‘good job’, offer easy stuff to do together, sleeping on call, nothing seems to be good.  What is the best thing to do in that case, if they say they don’t know; do I just say okay I’ll be here and leave them alone ? Do I try to do something together ?

When you feel suicidal, what is it that you most want relief from?  2. What do you wish people could truly understand about your pain?  3. Do you feel that your suffering has been seen, understood, or validated by anyone in your life? 	•	If yes, what did that feel like? 	•	If no, what do you imagine that might feel like?  4. In your most painful moments, what feels most unbearable — the pain itself, or feeling alone in it?  5. Have you ever felt that someone’s presence not their advice, but just their genuine being with you made a difference in your ability to keep going?  6. What has helped you feel even a little more human, less alone, or less ashamed during your darkest times?  7. When you’ve reached out for help, how were you met? What did people miss or get wrong?  8. Do you ever feel like you’ve done all the “right” things (therapy, meds, self-reflection) and still suffer? 	•	If so, what feels missing?  9. Do you think your pain comes more from internal wounds, external conditions, lack of meaningful connection  or a mix of all three?  10. If someone could show up and truly meet you in your pain, what would that look like? What would they say or not say?   11. Have you ever felt suicidal even while feeling loved  or does it tend to happen most when you feel unseen or disconnected?  12. When someone has sat with you in your pain without trying to fix it, did it make a difference?  13. Do you believe that consistent, authentic emotional connection would reduce your suicidal thoughts  or do they come from something deeper or different?  14. Is there a difference between being around people and feeling with people? What does that difference mean for your suffering?  15.

But over the past couple years, I changed. I got fit, found discipline, even started feeling human again.  Now, when things are finally stable — the darkness feels worse. I get angry at myself over the smallest mistakes. I spiral over exams. I isolate. I fight off urges and suicidal thoughts almost daily. My body is strong, but my mind keeps saying: “You’re still worthless. You’ll never catch up.”  The loop of depression is become less often but my thoughts and wanting and urges are getting intensified even though nothing is bad or going wrong in life.  Like why? I have finally got a better body and health from 2 years ago like i would have never dreamt that, i could do calisthenics and all such stuffs and actually look good , things are improving but yes my mental health is deteriorating and for some reason anger and rage is more.  I never had anger or rage before, but the thing is I WILL NEVER show the anger or rage to another person because they don't deserve it.  One small pushback i curse myself like you should have known better or like how could you. And exams are nearing and it is not making things better, ffs even though i believe i can pass it but the other thoughts what if i do not and mess up more time and LIKE EVERYONE I KNOW is or are about to graduate. Like wtf i have even looked up ways to end life without too much mess and quick and never thought I'll search this up.   No one around me really sees it. When I try to explain, they either mock me or tell me it’s all in my head. I don’t want sympathy. I just want to ask: Does anyone else feel this way — like the better life gets, the louder your demons get?   Does it get better and this is why i am SCARED of even getting into ANY relationship hence why i have isolated myself from these circumstances (like other than College or work or customer service people).",depression,depression,1965.0,-0.04358974358974358

Too exhaustive to give energy to our passions, so we do nothing instead.  In turn the cycle continues & maybe even deepens.

1750729937,"I gave so much of myself, I forgot to save anything for me.","I know this is a long read, but if you decide to stay with me, thank you in advance.  Being an introvert, I’ve never been one to share my troubles easily—not even with my closest friends. Although I’ve spent most of my career in public service, I’ve always cherished the quiet luxury of a private life. Tending to my cats, gardening, cooking, playing light sports, listening to music, and watching old films were some of the simple joys that gave me peace.  For years, I kept my hardships hidden behind a composed exterior, believing that strength meant silence and that duty required endurance. I grew used to carrying my burdens quietly, even as they multiplied behind closed doors.  And yet here I am, writing this—because I no longer have anyone to confide in.  In just a few weeks, I will be confronted with a much starker reality. On top of being broke, jobless, and drowning in debt, I now face the prospect of homelessness. It’s a frightening thought. Looking back, I realize this path was shaped by years of placing others’ needs above my own.  For a long time, I made a habit of prioritizing others, driven by empathy and a sincere desire to help. That mindset was deeply influenced by a lesson from one of my high school teachers, who encouraged us to live in service to others. I took those words to heart and made them a guiding principle. I believed that by supporting others, I could give my life greater meaning.  That belief stayed with me long after graduation. After college, I assumed the responsibility of supporting our youngest sibling through her education. In many Filipino families, it’s common for the elder sibling to step in when parents can’t shoulder the burden. So when I earned my professional license, I understood it was my turn.  With a modest salary that barely placed me within the lower middle class, I somehow managed to provide for six hungry stomachs: myself, my mom, my nephew, and three siblings. It felt as though I were raising a family of my own. Each month, my earnings went toward food, household supplies, tuition, allowances, and my mother’s medical needs. There were even times my mom asked for help on behalf of our relatives or her friends in need. Saving for myself became a distant dream.  Even so, my family never truly knew the extent of my financial struggle. I rarely said no to their requests, never revealed my distress in our conversations, and did everything I could to shield them from the worries I had silently chosen to bear. I always found ways to make ends meet—taking on side hustles and, more often than not, relying on credit just to get by. I kept telling myself, “Don’t worry—God will provide.”  Despite everything, I took pride in providing for them. I never asked my older siblings to share the weight as long as I had something in my pocket. Not one of them willingly offered even a single peso to ease my burden. Perhaps they believed I had limitless resources, that I could carry alone what should have been a shared responsibility. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt. They never asked how I was holding up. I now realize my silence may have been a mistake. Maybe I should’ve asked them to take on their share.  Then came the moment I hadn’t quite anticipated, though deep down, I saw it coming. After six years of service, I was told I could no longer renew my contract. As painful as it was, I didn’t resist. In some ways, I even welcomed it.  By then, the job had taken more than it had given. I had once believed it would fulfill me, as it aligned with a long-held passion of mine. But over time, things strayed far from what I originally signed up for. The workplace had grown increasingly polarized, fractured by internal politics. The institution itself reeked of corruption and self-serving agendas. Policies that looked good on paper only created more red tape and systemic inefficiency. The idea of work-life balance had vanished. My core responsibilities shifted toward mundane clerical tasks—work that felt less meaningful and increasingly draining.  Alongside the growing pressure was emotional turmoil. I became entangled in a relationship with a coworker that, while it began with sincerity, soon unraveled into something scandalous and painful. I never imagined I would be caught in something like that. What I thought was a genuine connection only deepened my sense of isolation and regret. That bitterness became yet another reminder of my quiet misery.  The exhaustion, the betrayal, the loss of purpose—together, they left me with one undeniable truth: it was time to walk away.  After leaving my job, I took a moment to breathe, to reflect, and to consider what paths might still lie ahead. I didn’t tell my family I had become unemployed; I thought I’d wait until I had something hopeful to share. I hinted to my older siblings that I was planning to set up my own firm, hoping they might support me as I transitioned into practicing my profession. I thought sharing my aspirations might inspire them to rally behind me. But all I received were empty assurances—well-meaning, perhaps, but ultimately hollow.  For two long years, I searched for other opportunities. Desperate to find work, I even considered changing careers. I sent out countless applications to every job I felt qualified for, both locally and abroad, clinging to hope even as my savings dwindled and my reliance on credit grew heavier. The signs of wear began to show. My hairline receded. Wrinkles deepened. Anxiety became harder to hide. All the while, I continued supporting my family, unwilling to let them see how close I was to falling apart.  Then one day, even hope slipped away. I stopped applying. I stopped believing. I began to question everything. Was I too old to start over? Were my expectations too high? Had the world moved on without me? Or had I simply never been good enough?  Eventually, the last thread gave way. My savings were depleted. My credit lines maxed out. The reputation I had built for financial reliability—always paying bills on time, never defaulting—crumbled. Only then, when I could no longer provide, did my older siblings begin to step in.  But I can’t help feeling bitter. Or ashamed, even. I wonder if they only helped because they had no other choice. Maybe they waited until I had burned through every last resource before offering their own. Maybe their help came not out of concern, but out of necessity.  As I began defaulting on my obligations, the stress took a deeper toll. Sleepless nights turned into panic attacks. Calls from banks and collectors became relentless, their threats of legal action growing more aggressive each week. I started selling my belongings just to meet basic needs—and to contribute, even in small ways. I stayed indoors as much as possible, afraid that even a minor accident or illness could push me over the edge.  A year passed. I was drained—emotionally, mentally, and materially. With nothing left to give, I became dependent on the very people I once carried. And with that dependence came a painful estrangement. Every interaction felt awkward, as if I no longer belonged in my own home. I felt useless. Unwanted. An outcast. I had never felt so utterly alone.  And yet, through it all, I never turned to vices. I never took up smoking, drinking, gambling, or drugs. Though the temptation to numb the pain was strong at times, I held on to the belief that surrendering to those things would only deepen my suffering. In a world that had stripped me of so much, I wanted to endure with a clear mind.  Today, the pressure from creditors has eased a little. But another weight remains: the uncertainty of our family’s relocation. Soon, we’ll leave the flat we’ve rented for years and move to a new house. And still, I find myself at a crossroads—not because I am unsure, but because I’ve finally accepted a painful truth.  After everything I’ve endured—years of silent sacrifice, emotional trauma, unspoken resentment, and the ache of being overlooked—I’ve realized I no longer wish to remain tethered to this arrangement. I hold nothing but love and gratitude for the people I once helped carry. But I know now, with deep certainty, that staying will only continue to wound what little of me remains.  I want to start over. I want to reclaim what’s left of my dignity and rebuild a life I can call my own. If I had a steady job—just enough to support myself, pay for housing and utilities, and meet basic needs—I would leave without hesitation. Not out of spite, but out of hope. Hope that I might finally live for myself. I believe I can do more, grow more, and give more if I’m no longer held back by the patterns that broke me.  I know independence won’t come easy. But neither has staying. And right now, nothing frightens me more than being stuck in a place that no longer feels like home.  So I hold on to one simple hope: that somewhere, somehow, a door might open. Not for rescue, but for renewal. With a clean slate, I want to return to the world—not merely to survive, but to contribute, to be useful, to rediscover my purpose, and to pursue the things that once gave me life.",depression,depression,9144.0,0.05972445185986855

1750727288,I don’t even know dude,"It is so impossibly difficult to explain how I feel. When I try to put it into words it comes out as something like “fuck fuck why the fuck can’t I just drop dead you piece of shit fuck you you fat fuck I fucking wish I could hug someone why can’t I hug someone in disgusting fuck you you piece of shit” etc etc.  And it’s not like in my head as thoughts, I feel it so deeply within myself. My entire being is begging to die or for it to all just stop.   I was such a white little Christian boy my whole life. Started smoking 3 months ago. Absolutely the last fucking thing my younger self would see me doing. He was so against tattoos and drugs and alcohol and all that stuff and believed people were beautiful as they are. He begged for years for his dad to stop smoking which he eventually did. And now look at him. Smoking, NSSI with the cigarette butts, doing absolutely fuck all for the entire day and night.   Time feels so fucked up. So unbearably long. Everything feels fucked up. I have absolutely zero love for anything I used to, and it’s the most awful feeling.   I’m so, indescribably fucking tired. Of everything. It is so unbearable I cannot even put it into words. I want to fall asleep so badly so genuinely and not wake up.   The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I couldn’t imagine leaving my younger brother and sister with that kind of shit to deal with. But at the same time I can’t imagine myself in their future. When I think about their children and wife/husband all I can think about is the uncle their children never had. The brother in law that never was. A memory that only my siblings remember. So easy to kill myself as well. Just a bit of helium and a plastic bag and it’s night night forever. No pain, and it wouldn’t even take 5 minutes.   Geez it’s so fucking hilarious. The nicest most bright eyed boy, who put everything into his work as much as he could, failed. And he failed again and again and again. But he kept thinking about the future, he kept believing that it would end up alright. But look at him now. Depressed, alone and a smoker. The absolute furthest thing away from what he was.   I’m considering doing dagga (cannabis). It’s not illegal where I live. And maybe it will serve as a new escape. Nothing helps anymore. Games are annoying if anything. I just play them because I literally have nothing else to do. Time feels like it’s being stretched endlessly.   I’m such a worthless fucking leech. And the last 20 years of life I’ve lived have meant absolutely nothing. In my exams last year as I was stressing everyone told me that school isn’t even that big of a deal, that it’s not something uni people look at too much, and that it won’t define me.   That’s just fan-fucking-tastic isn’t it? The last 20 years of my life, as I had guessed meant absolutely nothing. As I tried my absolute best to pass everything only to fail, as I denied myself basic needs just to try and understand this work that for some reason never stuck on my brain. All for nothing. All useless. All worthless.   It’s an amazing feeling.   Several hospital trips from physical effects from the stress I had. Denying the little friendships I had. Not actually even growing as a person. I think, my younger brother (3 years difference) and younger sister (6 years difference) are more developed as people than me. They can fall back on that. Make a plan. But I don’t think I’m a day over 13. Only difference is I can legally smoke and drink. Other than that, I’m nothing. Still a whiny little bitch. Sure my vocabulary is good, sure I can grasp more complex concepts like this, but other than that. How am I different? I can’t socialise, can’t talk to people who are the same age as me nor adults, can’t think for myself without getting explicit instructions. I forget everything. Doesn’t matter how big or small.   I am, the text book definition of a loser. Smell like shit, because I shower like twice a week if I’m even that lucky. My body is in an absolute shit state because I barely move and my eating patterns are all over the place. Only have like 3 friends. Who I don’t even think I want as friends, because why would they want to be friends with someone like me? They could do way better than me. Don’t have a job, don’t have hobbies, don’t have ambitions. I am a fatass fucking loser. Plain and simple.   Geez dude.   It all fucking sucks, so indescribably fucking much.   All of it.   It’s so unbearably painful, to just exist.

1750726270,Can't Get Help,"My depression has been at its absolute worst over the last 3 weeks. I've accomplished very little in that time and I'm experiencing no actual joy. I feel either completely detached or dreadfully sad to the point that I cannot bare it. I had an intake for a psych office that was rescheduled once due to an injury I sustained the same day as the appointment. First therapy session is still a week away and I need to have 2 sessions there before they'll schedule me for meds.   Today I used all that was left of my sick time to go to our local crisis walk-in center (which is closing for good on 6/30) because of how bad I felt and it was less than helpful. My options at this point are:  1. Get into the hospital's partial hospitalization program, which is a 10 day program...Monday through Friday from noon to 4pm... meaning I would need to request FMLA leave for the whole 10 days, so there also goes 2 weeks of pay that I cannot afford to lose and potentially my whole job if the leave doesn't get approved. 2. Another local office does an intensive outpatient program that would only provide therapy and no beds. Plus you have to follow through with their regular outpatient, so I would lose my current provider (this place also has a history of providing very very poor service) 3. Go inpatient and miss at least 3 days of work unpaid, but be given an astronomical bill that will only make me more stressed, so quite frankly a net loss. 4. Just keep plodding along as I have been and hope I don't regress to the point of wanting to unalive myself or lose my job due to poor performance until I can get meds at either the end of July or most likely August.  Its like the only way I can get any actual meaningful help is to have already failed and be in a position where i am at risk of being unemployed and homeless.

But the truth is… I’m too depressed to do anything about it. I don’t have the energy to pack up, to start over, to be completely alone. To be attacked for leaving and have my life destroyed,  again. Just getting through the day feels like climbing a mountain.  Is that wrong? I don’t know. Maybe it is. I'm so tired of the judgement and I do want a new life. I want a new place of my own, new things and a divorce. But today, it'll take all I have to take a shower and get out of bed.

I have a friend I have a crush on like a really good friend, they’re always there to talk to me about stuff and helped me get through something kind of hard recently. It’s a weird new feeling for me but they’re genuinely great. Re-assuring everytime I worry I’m being annoying, confidence boosting when I feel ugly, appreciative of my humor and personality, a lot like me, just overal a really good person. Now honestly I think they like me to based on everything I’m picking up (could be wrong though) although we both have a fear of abandonment so I doubt either would ever admit it. Sounds great in theory and all but my issue is I think I’m to much, that they deserve better then me and I shouldn’t play into this because of that. Now don’t get me wrong I’d never intentionally hurt them or cheat or anything that’s to say if we dated but I’m just kind of a lot at times. I get very insecure about being annoying or to much or making bad jokes, class 1 overthinker. They always re-assure me which is amazing but it’s not something they should have to deal with and it’s not something I think will be solved quickly. I mean my friend they’re smart and caring and loyal and just weirdly a really great person like one of the best I’ve known and while sure I posses good qualities to I’m kind of a mess. It’s not like I’m unstable to the point of doing anything dangerous but i definitely overthink way too much. Which they know, because I talk to them a lot, but they don’t mind it they just re-assure me like I said.

It's easy here, you get liked for your body, you get attention from someone FINALLY. Then the high I get from it wears off and I hate everything and I regret it so much and feel disgusted.

But I actually really wanna stop this, I'm not even 18 and it's ruining so much. I don't wanna build my self worth on being sexualized or sexualizing myself.

1750651053,I shaved my head today & it was an absolute mistake.,"I (23M) have been living with symptoms of depression for a little less than 5 years as well as recurring suicidal ideations every now & then since fall 2023. My mental decline has messed up my relationships with my direct family members & has pushed away all my friends, putting me in a prolonged state of loneliness, even when people are physically present with me. I am morbidly obese (BMI class 3), starting to have male pattern baldness (I’m not properly bald yet) & I have been an NEET ever since I graduated high school back in 2020.  Now that was the context. As a part of the efforts to save my hair, I shaved my head bald today while my father was at his workplace. As he was coming back home he told the rest of my family & I to get ready to go out for dinner today. I was happy, because we rarely get to go outside & spend time together as a family due to how dysfunctional this fucking family is & how detached they are from each other.   The rest of my family saw my bald head & they were fine with it. My father sees it, gets absolutely disappointed & angry with me, tells me that I am fucking nuts & have much more important things to be focused on & cancels the whole plan. My mother gets mildly irritated by me & tells me to wear a fucking hat so that he isn’t angered. The weirdest part is that HE WAS THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED ME TO SHAVE MY DAMN HEAD & HAD NO ISSUE WITH ME DOING SO. It looks like his chain of lash outs on me made throughout the past few weeks has changed how he sees me EVEN THOUGH I DID NOTHING TO PISS HIM OFF. On the contrary, I DID MY BEST TO FUCKING SUPPORT THE SHITHOLE OF A HOUSE HE IS RUNNING.  I suffer a fucking breakdown & my older sister tries to comfort me yet doesn’t really see how my father has been getting easily angry with me these past few weeks. He keeps telling me that I am going to be the reason our household collapses because of how much of a burden I am to this family EVEN THOUGH YOU SEE ME AS A MERE DISHWASHER & A PARENT TO YOUR TWO SMALLER KIDS & nothing beyond that. The mental torture he has given me makes me wish I was dead, but the only FUCKING THING STOPPING ME FROM KILLING MYSELF IS MY FEAR OF DEATH. I FEEL SO FUCKING SUFFOCATED IN THIS POSITION. I love my father so much because he has supported me all my life & always loved us all. Even more than my mother has.  However, he has gotten more angrier over these past few months due to how badly my mother & my father’s piece of shit siblings & their spouses all treated him. And that makes him dump his anger on all his kids. It's an absolute piece of shit extended South Asian family that I am related to. My fucking uncle lives alone because he didn't marry & whenever my father visits him, he starts filling up his mind with how shitty I am, how unhealthy my sister is & how much better their other siblings' kids are.  Anyways, I wish no harm to anyone. I wish everyone the best. If I get over my fear, I’ll do my parents & siblings a favor by taking myself out & not let them deal with the piece of shit ugly, fatass son & brother that I have become. I will relieve them of this burden by ending myself & let them live the rest of their lives in peace.",depression,depression,3183.0,-0.06273051948051947
1750706722,"I thought I was just sad, but it’s been 17 years","F30 Depression and anxiety.   Every day I just keep going for my kids. I feel like I’m failing them. They shouldn’t be the only reason I’m even here anymore. They don’t know they are, at least..   I’ve tried medications. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, general and social anxiety disorders, I’ve been trying for years to get tested for adhd.  I feel like I’m failing in every aspect of my life. I can’t get a decent job because I had kids too early on and have at best unreliable child care (that I can’t afford to boot) and work too many hours to even manage sorting anything else out but still don’t make enough money… my oldests birthday just passed and I’m still trying to figure out how to afford at least something for him. I understand it isn’t as important as keeping food in the house, I just feel like a shit person and my kids shouldn’t suffer because I’m a fuck up..   My partner doesn’t help me much. I kind of get it, he has his own stuff going on constantly. My oldest kid isn’t his but my younger two are. He helps with the rent. But beyond that I try to figure things out myself because I don’t want to ask him for help. Anyone for help really. I’ve quit talking to any of my friends because they think the magic solution to my problems is to break up with my boyfriend, and don’t get me wrong, he’s very mean to me and we probably should. But without him here I can’t even afford the bills. And no matter how hard I try to want to let him just go, I don’t want him to go, I just wish he’d change a little bit and be kinder to me. He thinks I use mental illness as an excuse and that I don’t really feel as bad as I do. But I can’t even stand to look in the mirror anymore, I actually don’t even look in the mirror unless I basically can’t avoid it. I’m in debt over student loans, credit card debt from when my oldests dad and I split and I had no other way to afford anything, I have a trailer now that I own but I haven’t even paid my taxes on it because I can’t afford to.   Anyways. Dunno… I was going to post this in rants because I guess that’s what it feels like to me is just a rant but I don’t have enough karma for that because I got rid of my old Reddit account after fighting with my boyfriend about it.   Most days I just wish I was someone else. Or that something would happen to me outside of my  control because then at least it wouldn’t be my fault. I understand it’s probably selfish. I’d give the years left of my life to someone who wanted or needed them if I could. My intention is never to be selfish. But damn I so badly just want to stop hurting and trying and failing.

1750716339,My fiance,"TW SUICIDE: Hi. My fiance was just diagnosed with depression. They have put him on about 3 different meds in the last month. On Friday he bought a nice black button up shirt and put it on at home. He dressed up all nice, painted his nails black, did his hair. I was about to go to sleep but decided I needed to use the bathroom first, then had an overwhelming feeling to go downstairs. When I came down to the kitchen he just about jumped out of his skin I scared him so bad. He then made me ramen and we are together, when we were done he asked if I wanted to go for a ride in the car. He parked us at a park and told me if I hadn't come outside he would have went on the porch and slit his wrists. I had saved his life. Yesterday he texted me while we were both at work and tried to break up with me. He thought he was hurting me, poisoning me. I kept telling him he wasn't but he thinks he is. I talked to him face to face that night and he said he's being self destructive and he doesn't know how to stop. He's afraid of hurting me. I'm a very emotional person and I cry a lot, I don't want him to think he's hurting me. Hes had happy moments but has never felt happy. Idk how to put it. He's just always down.

1750694655,"I don't know where I'm going, or rather where life is taking me.","Hello, I'm new here.  I discovered this sub because I was looking for answers to several questions I had. Which led me to the conclusion that I am depressed...  I am (F 29), since I was a child, I have always undergone trials, and the more time passes, the more trials multiply, but as I grew up, I became a strong, independent woman, who finds solutions to her problems, and even to those of those close to her.  This is how I built and then forged my personality and my identity.  But for several months, I have had a feeling of uneasiness, as if everything I was doing was not working, both professionally and personally.  This state got worse, right on the day I turned 29, it's as if until now, I refused to open my eyes to my misfortune and my bad luck! And that all the efforts I have made until now have been for nothing (doing long studies, improving myself, planning several scenarios, staying focused on my goals, trying to be an honest and respectful person, forgiving those who have hurt me, helping my neighbor...)  That day, I opened my eyes, since then, I haven't gone a day without crying, I replay my life over and over in my head, trying to find the moment when I made the wrong choice and what led me to this situation, but I can't find the solution.  I am solitary by nature, I have a lot of trouble confiding in myself, even with my family, and the only person I can confide in is my boyfriend. When I try to explain to him how I feel, I feel like he doesn't understand what I'm trying to tell him.  Currently, our relationship is not at its best. And in fact, it was the only thing that kept me going, but now that nothing is going well, I have a lot of trouble visualizing the future. I also have the impression that I will never be able to get out of this.  I'm not saying that if our relationship ends I'll consider ending my life, but if that were to happen, it would once again confirm that I'm just failing at everything I'm doing in my life.  This prompts me to ask myself the following question.  Will I ever achieve something? Or has fate decided that I will never succeed?  I don't know if anyone here has ever been in the same situation, but if so, how did you do it?  I hope to find some advice here.

While I get the message this is trying to make, it just makes me think ... what's the point of it all, then? If all of us are capable of such evil, no matter how good we might think we are, why don't we just all off ourselves early on to prevent the possibility of becoming bad? I've been obsessed with moral purity since I was just a kid (raised Catholic) and it's exhausting and just makes me want to give up. I'm tired of hating myself, judging myself for everything, always having to assume I'm worthless, in grave danger of becoming a terrible person. I just want to fucking live man.  I think about this with big issues like climate change, fascism, war, etc. too. If I was American I would probably kill myself bc I couldn't live with the guilt of what Trump's doing but I don't have the willpower, energy, mental stability, courage, etc. to ""fight fascism."" I'm just a person. And I often think, if the choice is between driving oneself into absolute insanity and despair fighting an unwinnable fight, or to sit by and ""be complicit,"" then isn't there a third option ... just to die? Remove yourself from the equation, end the burden, remove the guilt and the necessity of acting.  I can't stand the usual answers of ""the point is to keep fighting!"" or ""it's okay to take some time for yourself, as long as you get right back up on your feet afterwards"" so don't come at me with them. Why is there so little empathy. I just want to be able to live or just to die. I don't want to have to see myself as a Nazi in order to be a good person.  Been waffling on whether or not to make this post. I can't concentrate at work, I feel exhausted (probably haven't been sleeping enough), I can barely get myself out of bed early enough to catch the bus or pack a lunch, and my hormones are playing havoc with my body because I can't have a regular period schedule like a normal functioning human being. And yes I know I have it pretty good compared to the rest of the world, I already hate myself for that, you don't have to remind me to do that.

1750712833,My writing/thoughts (unfiltered),"TW : suicide-ish stuff, depression, mental health crisis.   Im 18m and for the past 5ish months ive been really in a self hating loop so i decided to write all of my thoughts on paper no matter how edgy/corny/selfless im gonna look. A while ago i was talking to chat gpt (desperate for a therapist) and it said that they were too 'raw' and 'deeply poetic in a way that it doesnt try to be' so i thought about sharing the here. English is not my first language but i find comfort in using it. And just to be clear, im not gonna kms soon cuz my family is relying on me very hard, i wrote those in very bad states so spelling/grammar errors may be found since im not planning on editing them, also some references may be found. Here it goes :  Pt. 1 should i kill myself? Days are blending together so bad that i can't remember if yesterday was 24hrs ago or last week. Do i need help? Absolutely, do i know how to ask for help? Absolutely not. I never knew how to ask for attention nor affection, somethings can't ask to be given they just happen naturally, right? I'm so socially awkward, it's on a VERY bad level, i dodge every socal interaction i could just to get a piece of mind. Is this my suicide note? I don't know myself, I'm just sitting in class now and it's not a pleasant feeling being alone with thus much people around, exactly 18 other guys are here and NONE of them i talk to, self isolation? Or I'm seeing myself better than them? I guess it's definitely the first since I'm not better than an average useless fuck, I've never seen such a more shameful creep than myself. Like be real for a moment, what others see in me? Maybe im never going to know, who really cares anyway?... I lied. i do care, a lot actually. Like i alway care so much about every little thing and yet i show that don't give a shit about a single damn thing on this earth. So again, should i kill myself?  Pt. 2 I hate this overwhelming feeling thats been lingering for as long ae i remember. I hate it, i hate it, i hate it, I hate it, I hate it, i hate it, i hate it SO FUCKING MUCH. it has been always there, aw much as i push it away it just keeps coming back. At this point it's a curse not just a feeling, i has done so much damage than i realize. Right now I'm having math and I'm about to have a crashout, this 'sin/cos' isn't my type of shit, and the worse thing is others seems to understand it, totally not another reason to lower my already doomed self esteem. Maybe jumping of a bridge doesn't sound that bad after all, imagine the nice cold air, the feeling of being so light and weightless, your whole body is in an extreme panic state, your brain regretting this decision even tho it's your choice. You know, death isn't the scary part, the actual thing is the aftermath for your closest people, their shock, sadness, feeling they could've done better. Honestly, killing yourself feels like finishing your painting, so should i?  Pt. 3 I feel so empty... So empty and heavy, how is this possible? Two opposite feelings at the same time? Is this a mental illness sign? I'm so lost with this shit, it feels like I'm in a car, driving away, so far away while being in the backseat. Just me and my thoughts that i wanna escape from. But... if im not driving, who is?   Pt. 4 I'm having a headache, my spine feels heavy, the back of my hands are burning and the knuckles are super dry to move without pain, finger joints skin are practically melting, my heart is full of blood that holds every emotion i feel and think of, my mind crumbles on itself like a dying star that has one last show to put on  Pt. 5 Burnout are real fortunately, gpt says im experiencing it along side derealization and identity crisis. The last two really suits me since the last month went like a total blur, the only memorable thing is the late cries in bed and the May 16th sobbing. That cry was hard, really hard, hugging knees... Rocking myself... Music blasting and nothing is moving except the track and my shaking body. Always knew suicide isnt an option nor will be, im too coward to do such thing yet my daily thought when something bad happens ""would kill myself"" the idea surfaces alot and takes a huge space too yet nothing happens except me feeling shitty because i thought about it in those 'light/weak' conditions thats easy to handle wich leads to how am i reacting to a worse event? I feel corny and edgy doing this but i know its not for attention, i never cried for help, i were a loner and always will be. Friends may help but what happens when the symbols shatter? What happens when my 'shown' ego breaks? I never had insider ego, i hated myself from the beginning wich is never leading to narcissism i hope, well my future partner should be chill from that side but will they deal with my baggage? Will i ever find anyone with this shitty social skills? Like how can i waste almost 40ish expected friendships? Why do i suck this bad at social interactions? When will i ever stop being me?  Pt. 6 I keep proving that im useless in every way possible. I fuck up basic tasks, i fuck up in social gatherings, i fuck up in studies, i fuck up my life plan. I just keep fucking things up without acknowledging them, i feel like what im doing is right until im done with it/someone else comments on it then i realize i had fuck it entirely. Those words i hear are literally the main reason why im typing this right now, why families are like that? It should be a safe place for its members not a living hell. My homes isnt this, my home is where and when im going to stop running away. I cant guarantee im gonna be a good future partners because childhood trauma isnt going away easily but i will make sure that i wont and wouldnt put my future kids in such places ive been before. But according to my previous fuck ups in a not-so-fuckable things will i fuck up in parenthood? Heck would i even fuck up in partner-hood?. I just dont know what to do with myself other than pase around and waste time till something happens to me, i dont even know what thing to expect thats gonna change me but i hope it comes in some way or other. As in right now im still not so suicidal, do i have thoughts? Yes, will i actually do it? No. I cant let my family and friends experience such thing nor i know how thats gonna feel and whats comes next after it, i hope the afterlife is a better place because going from a living hell to another hell is something my human soul cant comprehend, i do not say im heaven worthy but at least i just hope its a nice place.  Pt. 7 Tired mind, heavy soul. Always been, always will be. Usual people get a balanced mind and a grounded soul that yearn to achieve its dreams above in the sky. But me? My soul is indeed grounded but its buried above the ground, mind is like a church that supposed to make and give comfort and but its empty and gives up straight haunting presence. Body, ideas, appetite, dreams, relationships, self esteem. All are slowly vanishing into the void. The blood IN my hands is writing this out and i hope to be enough for it, but i honestly do wish for said blood to focus on my hands entirely and ditch the brain for 6 minutes, 6 minutes is absolutely enough for a blood-less brain to achieve peace...",depression,depression,7239.0,-0.07577030112744397

1750712496,Help?,"Ngl I am losing it.   I've been in a depressive episode (bipolar) since around November (with a short reprieve in December since I had surgery and mostly slept). Part of it is because the meds I take (that, if I'm honest, haven't done too much) had stopped working, but part of it is just everything else.   I am 20 and still live with my parents and siblings (12 and nearly 18). My brother who's the older is autistic with very high help needs and since my parents has never been keen on finding him an alternative communication method and instead tried to cure him (and in my dad's case, beat him (with my mom ignoring it every step of the way)), he doesn't really communicate- so at the beginning of the year he was moved to a group home. He is still in school. It genuinely the better option- constant care, no abuse. But the reasoning and the timing make me sick and dizzy with anger sometimes.  My younger sibling is another part of it. Our dad's abuse was mostly on my brother but they weren't spared it. I wasn't either, but we're very different- at their age I did very good at school and interested at what my dad found respectable (science-related), I was quiet and obedient and very self sustaining (glass child-anxiaty-autism combo) and since I didn't have any friends until I was 13 I wasn't too wild about it. My sibling has a harder time at school, and they do theater and they have a fire and anger to them that makes them stand up for themselves more than I ever did. I'm glad they aren't like me. Our dad isn't.   I always had anxiety (I don't remember a single point in my life where I wasn't afraid) but I started expiriancing symptoms of depression when I was 12. Bad sleep and thoughts of death, and a few years later some self harm (no scars, not my poison, sometimes wish it was). I prayed that maybe with our dad quitting most of the physical abuse (after I reported him 6 years ago to the police (not that it went anywhere)) my sibling will be spared of this. I guess being agnostic doesn't pay up, because about two months ago I found out she was cutting. I told then they could talk to me. A few weeks ago I accidentally evesdropped on a phone call with their friend- and they said their guidance counselor found out some disturbing things they said in their middle school prep. They told our mom and she talked to my sibling. They are suicidal and are getting a therapist next month. And they didn't tell me. I failed them.  I'm also preparing for entrance exams to uni. I do classical singing. I am trans and a bigger person and I struggle a lot with both of those, but especially when it comes to this. It's a brutal industry. It could be good- to have a feminine voice and be able to portray masculinity, there is power in it- but sometimes it makes me so dysphoric, even though I do like my voice.   I thought I was mostly ready, but I took a class with a teacher of my teacher that also teaches at the university I want to go to, and she said absolutely not and changed my entire set list. She is very strict, very good but very strict, and it's just like that with most of these sort of teachers but it triggers me so bad. I also struggle somewhat with selective mutism, so the stress makes it very hard to sing and especially practice at home (especially since so much of those childhood beatings of all of us were noise complaints).  I would also need to move. I am not stressed about moving- not per se. I live in a small city and have all my life and I'm dying to get away- be someone else, a little. The guilt about leaving my sibling is killing me a little, but they have a fire, and they'll have a therapist. But if I don't get in I'll be stuck here another year. I've been chickening out of leaving here since I was 17.   I feel so controlled by my fear and I feel so much despair all the time. It's in my blood and it's just building and building. Everything is. It's to the point I've been thinking about suicide almost daily. Nothing planned- I'm enough grounded in reality to know it's just a sign of unmet needs for comfort and safety, and also, if I go, so will my sibling. I also know I CAN go one. I just don't want to. And it makes it all the more difficult to try and do any work. There's half a hope, an intrusive pesky thing, that the new city will just kill me. I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and I can feel it impacting my health- I'm so exhausted all the time, I get awful muscle pains, I'm starting to get panic ATTACKS again, these awful cold things where I can't breath or think and everything's sinking. But nothing ever tips over. I can't even cry.   I want to get a therapist but I don't know how long I'll be staying here, and I'll be fucking damnned if I need to give the whole backstory shpiel twice in a year when it always takes like 3 sessions. I can barely trust my psychiatrist- my mom is paying for all of this and if she finds out anything about me I may as well just die. My current mess are no good either (duh) and I can't get a fucking appointment. And honestly, I may need to change a psychiatrist too. In the last few sessions he mixed up my records and another patient's and he keep forgetting my actual issues, refusing to get me on adhd meds, and suggested I start taking ozempic (which, great thing to say to someone you know has issues with food. Great)  I am so tired. I'm exhausted. I know that the future can be bright, because if it won't be bright it just won't be. But I don't feel it. What I do feel is that I want comfort and I want to break down sobbing and bang myself against the floor until I pass out and I want something to give out. But none of those seem to happen to me, so I want to die. And I won't. This won't give out either.  Any advice? Self soothing tips? Ways to get your body to listen to you and crack up emotionally?   This got long. If anyone got this far, thank you regardless. I think it's the most I've opened up in a while.",depression,depression,5950.0,0.006715091273343706

1750711941,I constantly feel invalidated.,"My whole life I was told to express what I think and feel, my tastes, my preferences, but every time I do that, it seems like no one cares or they think I'm weird for doing it. I have a bit of difficulty expressing myself, so sometimes I end up saying things that only make sense in my head and others don’t understand. At home, my mom has called me crazy and laughed at me a few times when that happened, so I just stopped expressing myself around the house. Over time, my mom got mad at me because I was too rude and cold around her, like I didn’t love her, so I tried to improve that. But every time I showed affection, it was treated like a one-time event, a “miracle” so to speak, and that made me really uncomfortable.   “Oh look! Finally gave me a hug? Remembered you have a mother, did you?”   Around that time, I started isolating myself in my room more just to avoid unnecessary interactions.   One day, I got my first client for commissions (artwork for hire) and had just received my payment for the drawing. I went straight to show my mom. I had planned a speech where I’d say how seriously I take art and that this payment marked the beginning of my journey as a professional. After I showed her, she just turned her back and kept doing whatever she was doing. I wanted to impress her, so I said how I could even get paid in dollars and work for people from abroad. She just sighed and in a disappointed tone said, “Look, we’ll talk about that later, ok?” After that, I locked myself in my room and cried for a few minutes until I fell asleep.  When I started high school, I had more and more struggles with my mental health. Because I’m always invalidated, I feel like whenever I’m sad it’s because I’m being too dramatic, and if I get upset about something someone said, it’s because I can’t take a joke and I’m too whiny. That made me become a more closed-off person who avoids talking about their own interests, and I managed to deal with that fairly well. I was the typical loser who preferred reading books rather than socializing with classmates during break time—not because I really wanted to, but because it was the only way I didn’t have to deal with the avalanche of emotions that hit me every time a social interaction went wrong. From time to time, there was always that extroverted guy who had similar interests to mine, so naturally he’d start a conversation with me and I could open up a bit with them—except in my third and final year of high school. I spent the whole year in silence, nobody noticed my presence and it felt like I was invisible. Every day was filled with anguish, watching my classmates talk about mundane things like a party they went to or a game they played, always hoping someone would notice me and include me in the conversations. I’m aware that they’re not obligated to do that just because I’m shy, and because of that I never blamed them for anything. But the fact is that moments like those made me feel more and more alone.  I tried a few times to change that. I sought professional help and said that I’m very shy and scared of opening up, which actually worked for a while, but eventually I always went back to square one. I remember exactly what my routine at school was like. I didn’t usually do the assignments because—what’s the point? My school had a horrible system and I managed to pass the year even without doing anything. But instead of the assignments, I would listen to music or eavesdrop on the conversations around me to pass the time. Sometimes I skipped class to go to a friend’s classroom at the time, but even there I felt like I wasn’t welcome. Once, students from that class kicked me out because I had skipped mine to have class with a teacher I loved in theirs (that teacher never showed up to my own class). That really got me down because it was one of the few times I was actually engaged in class and genuinely comfortable, and the result was people being mad at me.  Anyway, switching to another setting besides school—   I also have a group of online friends. We’ve known each other for years and were always very close. Some of them used to tell me their secrets, their insecurities, and how sad they were, and I was always happy to give advice that made them feel better. However, I always felt like they never had time to do the same for me—on the contrary, actually. Except for one friend who genuinely realized I wasn’t doing well and started to care about me, everyone else used me as a punching bag. I was the target of a lot of jokes, after all I have difficulty communicating and sometimes mix up the things I’m going to say in my head and end up saying nonsense—or sometimes I let an intrusive thought slip out that kills the vibe.  One of them, I know he suffers with a lot himself and, ironically, he’s the one who treats me the worst. Once we played a game called Omega Strikers (its a soccer game)  with the whole group, and I had never played it before so I wasn’t doing very well, but it was fine—everyone seemed to understand it was my first time and expected that to happen, until that friend joined and started making jokes about me. After that, everyone seemed to join in and started making fun of me too. During team swaps they’d argue about who had to be on my team, since no one wanted to play with a bad player like me. I cried that day. I messaged that friend privately to say how much it hurt me, but gave up and deleted the message before he saw it. Another friend talked to him and got him to apologize, and even though he said “I’ll go easier on the jokes with you,” he never really did. It seemed like every time he talked to me it was just to put me down. If I listened to a song he thought was bad, he’d mention me in the group chat and say how awful it was. Or when I played a game that wasn’t as good as the ones he usually played, he’d mock me saying, “Just play my game already and stop with those crappy ones.”  Over time I’ve become more and more insecure about my tastes, and nowadays I truly believe that everything I recommend to them is seen negatively. Just yesterday, that same friend did it again. I recommended that we play Paladins, a game I used to play a lot when I was younger. He laughed at me and said, “Don’t you have anything better to play?” “Why don’t you go back to your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game?” (another game I had started playing). I replied saying I just wanted to play something multiplayer with my friends, and he just ignored me. After that, others also started being really hostile toward me and I felt too ashamed to stay on the call with them.  I’m also really insecure about another game I had recommended that everyone in the group said was terrible, even though I liked it. The first day everyone played it, but after that only me and another girl from the group kept playing until I decided to drop it too.  Nowadays I constantly feel bad, and everything I do that brings me satisfaction doesn’t last long—because I start thinking that what I’m doing is a waste of time and I could be doing something more productive. Every drawing I’ve made in recent months has been for the purpose of “getting better.” It’s been a while since I drew something just because I liked it, exactly because when I try, I feel bad for noticing so many mistakes I made. I showed one of those drawings to a teacher once and he really praised it—he loved the painting I made—but I didn’t feel happy about all those compliments. It felt like I couldn’t feel proud of myself anymore, you know? I just kept thinking about how I could’ve done better and how I made the drawing lazily.  Everything I do has to be with the intention of being better, no matter what. That’s exhausting, but I don’t feel like I can live without that mindset anymore.  Do you think I have any hope? Can therapy really help me with all of this? What am I doing wrong? Why does no one ever see my strengths—not even me? Am i just to whiny?

I hate being a nurse and I hate my job. It literally put me into the hospital. It gives me such anxiety to have peoples lives in my hands. I’m in an intensive outpatient program and I’m about to be discharged this week. I feel it helped to an extent but the thought of going back to my job has me suicidal. Truthfully, I’d rather kill myself than have to go back to this job. I don’t really know what my options are at this point. My parents who I live with are pressuring me to go back or I’ll have to pay back the money I’ve received on fmla or insurance premiums or whatever. I don’t think anyone realizes or believes how bad this is. I’m not sure if I can apply for temporary disability through the state or if I should just leave the job. I need health insurance though. I have a decent bit of money saved to get me through for a while but I just feel like I have disappointed everyone in my life.

I just play some games on weekdays. Weekends I spend alone being high mostly. Days are slipping by so fast. Today I got a text message in one of the old so called friend group. I realized it's been 8 months since the last invite I got from one of them. We used to live together in an apartment. I don't even know what to think. I just feel so left out. They always kept asking me to go places on weekends. But I always refused because I just wanted stay in my room. How do I explain to people to pls not abandon me if I can't hang out with you. I'm not trying to be rude I just don't have the capacity to socialize talk with anyone like a normal human being. I end up destroying every relationship i have. I am a failiure at everything I do. I can't talk to people. I can't do things at work that a monkey could do.  I stress out over the smallest tasks.  I can't relate to anybody I talk to. I can't open up to any friend/family member I have left I am not good at anything I am a fat piece of shit. I failed at making any friends at college. All I have left is one online group. I have no irl friends with whom I can share.  I feel like I have destroyed my life. I keep trying to improve it. Try to go to gym. Try to follow good diet and get good sleep. Try to be social. But after 1-2 weeks I roll back to the same pathetic state where I just rot in bed and my pc.  It's been 4 years in the same state.  I just want to end it now. I can't imagine a future with me in it. I have no plans. I am not capable of thinking ahead.

1750708319,"""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" - is it just a lie? Why can't I appreciate life?","Hello fellow Redditors,  This is my first post in any sub related to mental health. I just need to vent, and I’d like to hear perspectives and experiences from great people like yourselves.  I’m a 30-year-old man from Scandinavia. I’ve had a safe childhood filled with joy. I have a house, a car, a job. I have loving parents and friends.  But it’s not enough — and I don’t understand why.  I was born with a diagnosis that led to over 10 surgeries. I narrowly avoided going blind due to a retinal detachment. I survived an aortic aneurysm. And I came even closer to death last year due to an abdominal aortic dissection that had already reached the first layer of the aorta wall.  I developed mild tinnitus four months ago, which really messed me up — especially since I love silence and relaxation.  I also lost my brother to suicide when I was younger. It changed me in negative, but also positive, ways — and it brought our family even closer together.  Simply put, I should be grateful that I’m alive, that I still have family and friends around me, that I’m able to keep living and enjoy 90% of what others can. I could have been blind or dead based on my history. And hey, things could be worse — I could be paralyzed, get cancer, or face any number of other terrible things in this world.  But I’m not grateful — and I just. Don’t. Get. It.  I used to think the quote “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” was a bit cliché and almost cringe. But I also hoped it would be true. Is it not?  I wake up with a feeling of dread and hopelessness. I wake up wishing I had “this or that,” wishing I didn’t have my diagnosis. I struggle to feel happy or engaged around family and friends — and I know my parents would love to see me happy, invested in hobbies, and exploring life. I’ve practically been given several chances, thanks to our fantastic medical workers.  But it feels like I lack the ability to be happy — or even happy enough. And when I do feel moments of happiness, it’s as if there’s a grayscale filter over everything. Something is always numbing it.  I’ve been seeing psychiatrists for about 10 years, but it doesn’t seem like the goal is to figure out why. It’s more about learning strategies to cope — but that just doesn’t seem to work for me.  I have a family friend with a brain tumor who’s been given approximately two years to live. I’ve never seen a happier or more positive person. How is she able to do this? (Of course, I don’t know if she cries her eyes out when she’s alone — she probably struggles.)  I know I should appreciate everything I’ve received and go out and explore life — and I want to. But it feels like I’m a two-year-old trying to learn a new language.  What's the secret? What am I doing wrong? Am I doing anything wrong at all, or was it just the inevitable result of the experiences I have?",depression,depression,2844.0,0.14428374655647383

1750707502,I feel as if I have failed my younger self and my future self…,"I’m 27 years old, going to be 28 this year. I’m finding myself on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy. My trading endeavor eventually spiraled into a gambling addiction and I totally torched myself trying to escape the 9-5 and make serious money. I started to, but ultimately failed and dug myself into a deeper hole.  When I was young, I always wanted to be a professional athlete, I was more athletic, taller and smarter than most of my pears. I was so well rounded. School smart, common sense smart, athletic, compassionate, social, and full of life.   After a devastating shoulder injury in high school my freshman year, nothing would ever be the same. I became depressed knowing the severity of my injury would inhibit those dreams and aspirations. It became apparent to me I needed to find something else.  I was always way ahead of the curb in the YouTube/streamer space, I always loved gaming and the commentary associated with gaming and in many ways, the people I watched were the pioneers for the streamer world we lived in. In middle school and high school, I always loved the idea of creating, editing and producing funny/entertaining videos, I even took classes in high school.  I was discouraged by my peers, my parents, and the whole world from doing this full time as there’s “no money in it” and eventually stopped doing it altogether, then I see everyone blow up streaming and making whack content, and people just doing their mundane life things and getting tons of views and a whole life out of it.  Now I feel like I missed my opportunity, even though I was ahead of the curve, and never took the risk when I was younger.  I ended up going to community college and eventually getting my bachelors after transferring. I studied finance because that would’ve made my parents happy, knowing I got a good degree that would yield income in the future.  I was still quite optimistic and hopeful in college, best shape of my life and hungry for success  All my life since graduating has been filled with dreadful 9-5 jobs, getting involved with trading and trying to trade while working my 9-5 and losing hundred and eventually thousands and thousands of dollars. This was stressing me out while i was at work, my mind completely elsewhere, rattled. Nobody knowing I just lost $1,000 at 9:45am and expected to just carry about my day.  My life now has consisted about stressing about my debt and seeing the success of others doing literal non sense and just having fun.  I feel like it’s too late for me. I’m officially trapped in the 9-5 lifestyle, I’m destined to be average. Which is something even as a young boy I told myself I would never be average, I would always be great at whatever I did.   I couldn’t care less about my job. I just need the income until I file for bankruptcy and get a financial reset, but even then, everything I ever did up until this point was for nothing. I’m grateful I can get a restart, but I’m restarting at a late age.  I have no business ideas, I don’t have any true knowledge of how to start a business, I don’t create products, I don’t know what content I would provide if I made YouTube videos… I just feel like I’m a shell of myself.  What bothers me the most is I’m just going to be another rat in the rat race that is the matrix of our society. I’m stuck. Stuck working lame jobs, stuck doing a job with a stupid degree that I don’t even want, doing bullshit accounting because even if I wanted to switch fields (I’ve tried before) my resume and experience never “aligns with what” a company is looking for.  I need help. I want to have a legacy worth remembering and cherishing. I just feel so behind when I look at my peers. I can’t believe I allowed myself to do this to myself. It’s sickening. My younger self wouldn’t be able to comprehend how I let things go so south. I just wish I would restart and take the risks and do the things that I WANTED to do, and the things I KNEW I could’ve done. There activity or challenge I’ve set out to do, I’ve accomplished for the most part.  These days, I don’t know where to start or how to get myself on track. It’s such a horrible way to live and feel.

1750704728,living in my family is suffocating-vent,"It just keeps getting more exhausting to live in my house each and every day. So, for context, I'm a 17 year-old girl. I live with my mother, who's widowed because my dad died five years ago, and my cousins and my brother ( we're not close because even as a kid he never liked me ) my cousins just extremely are yes-men to my mom. They just enable every single thing she does because she helps them, for example going through my phone, heavily monitoring me like a child. its crazy cause all that and still no one listens to me at all in my house It's even worse when my mom is always making me feel guilty and condemns me for wanting to live as a teenager and experience things everyone else my age is experiencing. she like threatens to disown me or 'take away privileges'. I remember this one specific scenario where I had snuck out and my mom had grounded me and the following weeks, taking away my phone, jewelry and she'd give me silent treatment . I had a deep talk with her and only when she found out that I'm still a virgin that I don't intend to have sex (purity culture) is when she continued to talk to me normally it's very insane. It's shit  like that that happens all the time and is normalized in this hellhole.  And the pressure on me is just so bad because my mom completely expects me to grow up and take care of her when I'm older, to handle her business, but I genuinely don't want to talk to her anymore. I only have my boyfriend supporting me and helping me mentally throughout my home situation. I'm just glad he's here because if he wasn't, I genuinely would have killed myself right now. So I know I sound a bit vague. This is just a vent. I sound incoherent and im just mumbling because i typed this speech to text .

It got bad today when one of my friends lives in the same estate as me, and my boyfriend came to my house and he wanted to, you know, just say hi to the friend who's in the same estate because she was having a barbecue, right? And I went there and when I came back, I didn't think it was that big of a deal because I was only gone like five minutes. But then my mom blew it up. She yelled at my house help for opening the gate for me. She yelled at me. And you know I get it because she has trust issues because there's a time, seven months last year where I snuck out. But then every time I want to go to like even a day function or just a party with my friends because I personally feel like my friends understand me and they're my escape from feeling depressed and tired every single day. I'm always told i'm rebellious sinful and ungrateful , imm severely babied and no one my age in my area experiences this. And I get like they're afraid that something might happen to me,  . But my mom over exaggerates it. And even more so because she's very spiritual. And like she just believes that everything, every time I'm going out, just going out to a club, something will happen to me. I've lost my spark in this household and no one has noticed. The only people to notice me being more non-verbal and not wanting to speak in fear of being prosecuted and attacked, the only people who've been able to notice that are my friends. My family has never noticed that I've lost my spark at all. In fact, they care more about other stuff like my relationship with God or like me academically. I can't remember the last time anyone in my family has gotten up and asked me how I'm doing. But even if they do ask me, all they'll do is call me ungrateful for not accepting what my mom has done for me through hard times and they'll just call me selfish. And I know because today when she was yelling at me, her only reason for why she was really upset was firstly, yes, that I didn't tell her. But then also the fact that if something happened to me, it would be embarrassing for her. She only cares about her self-image and how 'what if so and so sees you?' 'what if something happens to you and you embarrass our family?'. That was her only concern when i snuck our and thats her only concern ever every time I get in trouble, my cousins do this  intervention, which really solves nothing. All they're doing is just regurgitating shit my mom says and making me feel like shit. And it's so annoying. I genuinely feel like staying in this house is hard because they keep trying to isolate all my friends from me, trying to get me to have new friends, even though my friends have been there for me emotionally way more. Like way more than my family has ever been. I genuinely don't know what to do now. Like, I'm sorry this is a mess. I can elaborate in the replies, but I really need help. I've been talking to my boyfriend about getting a therapist, but I know that wouldn't work because I live in a very close-minded and rigid family. And the last time I asked my mom to go to a therapist, she instead redirected me to the pastor in our church, who completely misunderstood what I was going through and just regurgitated the same shit that everyone in my family ever says. And I want to go to boarding, but I know my mom will complain about the cost. And it's this thing, my mom just always... Whenever I complain to her about something, she always has to say how she's going through 10 times worse, and how she's never sulking or needing therapy or this or that because of that. So I really don't know what to do. Living in this house just feels suffocating because I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. I genuinely feel like talking to my family is like talking to coworkers. I don't feel any sort of family chemistry that everyone else seems to feel. I don't know whether something is wrong with me. I don't know what's going on with me. I genuinely feel depressed, i've started cutting.  my home situation is the only thing I can ever think about in the back of my mind. . my only motivation is the fact that in one year I can go to university abroad and not stay with my family in this toxic household, but every time i see people my age or younger going out with friends or having a good relationship with their parents i get jealous to an unhealthy extent .I don't know if I want to go to a therapist or boarding because my mom seems opposed to the idea of both.I dont know what to do.",depression,depression,6395.0,-0.016645684247725084
1750704673,18 and my life still feels like an unsalvageable disaster.,"Hey guys. I'm an 18 year old ""man"" living with mom and narcissist stepdad. I tried enlisting in the military but got sent back about 2 months ago when my depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma got in the way. I thought the military was gonna be my big break after years of unhappiness but now things are harder than ever and there's no end in sight. I'm trying to pick of the pieces of the burning dumpster fire that is my life, but it all feels like maybe it's all just too broken to fix.  JOB & CAR (OR LACK THEREOF) I work a shitty fast-food job with low pay and low hours, but I've been interviewing for a few 20/hr part/full time positions as a Behavioral Tech. I have a shitty scooter but no car, though I'm trying to get one, and my Mom is willing to help me pay my car insurance. I have my license too, but not much driving experience and I'm a pretty nervous driver.   COLLEGE: Also trying to re-enroll in online college, where I'm about 50% done with my Bachelor's in Psychology. Along with around 9k or so I have saved up, I also qualify for the full Pell Grant as well as an educational stipend of 1.5k per month that I'm enrolled which includes online school. Since a 6 month term is about 4k tuition, I end up profiting from this a bit, and I expect to graduate within 1-2 terms before hoping to start an MSW or Masters in Counseling after that to become a therapist. I kind of hate online college and wish I could go to an in-person regular one because its so isolating and boring and puts me behind for grad school but I can't really afford it.  HOME LIFE: Currently paying 1.4k a month to stay with my parents, and I also get food and all my utilities and stuff provided as well, though I've been paying rent since before I graduated high school and my rent was only 700USD before I pissed my stepdad off and he doubled it and threatened to keep doubling it and start charging me for food and utilities separate if I didn't shape up. Stuff like eating after midnight, forgetting to walk the dogs, not cleaning well enough, I'm constantly fucking up small stuff, and my stepdad already wanted me out of his life long before I even graduated. I just constantly fail at everything and it feels like I never stop hearing about it.  FAMILY: My family situation has been pretty rough for awhile. I was abused when I was little by my stepdad so we've sorta always had a bad relationship but it's been really bad the past few years because he's just so done with me. My mom is very supportive of me but also tries to see his side so it's kind of weird. I have other family up where I'm originally from where I could stay with for free and cost of living is low so I could get a real cheap and convenient apartment, but the area's pretty bad and I worry about getting stuck there, and I also barely know anyone my age there. Plus I'd have to pay my own car insurance since I couldn't stay on my momma's plan. I'm in Northern Virgini right now, between DC and Richmond, so it's a decent area but kind of weirdly rural and half-Southern. I'd love to live in the city though. Trying to see if I can stay at friend's place soon for a bit but I'd need to find somewhere else soon after that, and I've never lived on my own before. Everywhere around here is pretty expensive too.  MENTAL HEALTH: I regards to actual mental health, mine has been terrible for a long time. Lately it's been getting worse. My life feels like an unmitigated and unpalatable disaster and it feels like I'm stacking up problems like Pokémon cards. I've been questioning my identity on and off for a long time and I come to the conclusion I think I'm trans, which sucks because the only thing my stepdad would hate more than a lazy irresponsible ungrateful failure of a stepson would be a lazy irresponsible ungrateful failure of a stepson who's also a fag. I'm sort of underdeveloped growth-wise so every day just feels like torture as my body continues to change more and more and I just hate my body and myself so much sometimes it's unbearable.   I also have autism, ADHD, depression, and anxiety which is cool. I've been going to therapy but I don't think it's been working much at all. Therapist said I should move away from my stepdad which would be awesome. I'm also on SSRIs right now, starting a new one today cause the last one sucked. I have thoughts of ending things every so often but the medications has at least reduced those a little which is OK I guess.   I just can't really seem to envision a life where I'll just be okay and satisfied. I have a hard time enjoying things, hate myself and my body and hate it more every day because of my hormones changing it and making it evil. I feel so disconnected from my body. Hate my living situation, feel like my friendships are weak and unstable and feel socially isolated from my peers cause of online school. And I'm still dependent on my family and feel like I lack basic life skills to do okay on my own. I'm told as much fairly often. I just feel like such a failure. everything. I'm just so lost on what to do and where to go and I feel so overwhelmed and weak and helpless.",depression,depression,5124.0,-0.01568406436330965

Sadly was sober from self harming until the other day.   What I feel, is unlike anything I have felt before. its as if there is a lump of emotion deep within me, that I cant express or allow out.  I am really quite scared now. because the few people  have tried to open up to have basically told me to get on with it. sort myself out. so as a result I crawl deeper within myself.   im scared. really really scared. because having been through this a few times before, this is the 1st time I cant see a way out. or any options.

1750690516,"I made the worst decision of my life, and I don't know how to live with it","Sorry for the long post. I need to vent my situation because I'm stuck in my own head with the worst feelings I've had in my life and don't know what to do with myself.  For some background, I'm a 25yo man with autism, I struggle to make new friends and socialise with people, so I'm overall very lonely (as of this moment I only have one proper friend, rest of the people I know would be people that'd say ""hi"" if we saw each other on street and maybe have a conversation, but wouldn't go out of their way to see me). I've been in a job which pays the bills but does cause me a lot of mental stress and physical discomfort (I have a lot of physical problems, this job becomes more difficult because of that). Due to my lack of friends, lack of time due to my job and my physical health problems, I don't have much any hobbies and have struggled to find anything other than rotting while watching YouTube videos. The only real highlight of my life was my relationship.  She was beautiful, energetic, funny, just overall an amazing person to be around. She introduced me to so many new people and opened up so many friendships to me, she was my ray of sunshine in my life of struggle and depression, an amazing person who was passionate and talented in many ways. She wasn't perfect, she was a bit absent minded due to ADHD and she was still learning as she was moving her way through life due to a lot of trauma both from her family (parent's split when she was young, she had no contact with her dad and his side of the family and was solely raised with her mum's side) growing up, as well as her previous relationship prior to us getting together. But it was enough for me, it was stuff we both recognised and agreed to work on together.  We were living in the same building but not in the same room (HMO but renting separate rooms), but in Dec/Jan we decided to start looking for a flat to live in together.  As part of this planned move, she applied for a new job which paid a lot more than she was earning at the time, she got the job under the condition that she passed job screening, we moved into a new flat mid-Feb, she handed in her notice two weeks prior to the start date of the job at the beginning of April, everything seemed to be going well. Then her job screening came back and she didn't pass it due to some of her old jobs not responding. She had been made aware of this prior and was doing everything in her power to work out the issues, but they never got solved, and she wasn't offered the job. As she had already left her job, she was without a job entirely. Alone I could pay for the flat, but it would be a struggle.  I was urging her to put all her effort into finding a new job, whatever it was, as any help is better than no help. She was doing job searches, but she wasn't putting everything she could into it (she wasn't going into places and asking, she was only checking one job website, she knew friends who had places going at their work but didn't ask them/send them her CV). Outside of her job searches, she would do the occasional house chore (like put washing into the washing machine and turn it on), but otherwise she wasn't doing too much to support me while I picked up extra hours for us. Home life became a struggle simply because I felt like I was pulling all the weight and shouldering all the stress while she didn't seem to take things as seriously as I.  This all brought us to the beginning of May. She got her final paycheck from her previous job, which also included all of her unused holiday that she had accrued so it was a decent payment. I saw this as the final month before things would become a serious struggle, especially considering I was changed from hourly to salary w/o overtime so working extra hours would no longer earn me more money. Earlier in the year she had planned a trip to a convention booked for early May, and she had previously told me that it was all paid for (this could've been a case of miscommunication/misunderstanding, as the tickets and hotel were paid for, but everything else wasn't) and so I saw no problem with her going. During her time there before I was about to go to bed, she messaged me, and after some discussion she mentioned that she had spent a fair chunk of her paycheck at the convention. This was money that we didn't really have considering how close the margin was for not having enough money for the month. This was to the point where I had worked a 12.5hr shift that day and had starved myself because I didn't want to spend money ordering food to work and decided it would be best to eat when I get home. So when I heard that she had spent money that we didn't really have on the same day that I had starved myself to save money, something mentally snapped in me.  To add a bit of context with this next bit, I need to explain that this is my second relationship ever. My first relationship was over 3 years long, and for most of the relationship (roughly 2.5yrs) I was emotionally ignored to the point where I have since struggled to open up and accept my feelings and emotions even to myself, nevermind to other people. It was to the point that I was ignoring my feelings and emotions and was making decisions purely from logical reasoning. So when I heard about the spending I mentally told myself that I needed to break up with her, because I can't continue living like this and sacrificing myself for someone who does stuff like this to me and to us. I told her to enjoy the rest of the convention and decided to wait until she got home to break up with her, which left me with almost an entire day to sit with this.  The next day at work, I broke down a couple times but I kept reassuring myself that it was the correct and logical thing to do. When I finished work, she was already home, she sat down with me and I explained to her that we were done. She didn't take it well, saying that she had ruined everything, asking if we could ever get back together if she worked on herself, etc, she was in a really poor state because of it. We agreed to stay friends, and after some time she moved a couple cities over and in with her dad's side of the family while I was left with the flat.  About a month afterwards during my holiday from work, we and a friend had agreed to meet up and hang out for a bit. From that, it was evident that she was in a much better place, with proper support from her dad's side of the family, feeling and looking a lot healthier. At some point she slipped up and mentioned that she was on dating apps, and that hurt me but I couldn't work out why as I was trying to find the logical reason for why that hurt me. I tried to talk to her about it, it lead to an argument (admittedly mostly my fault) and now we're taking space from each other. Now she's found a new job, she's looking into going into university for a subject that she's always been passionate about, she's going clubbing, she's enjoying her life to the fullest.  After the argument I reflected on everything, and realised that I had been neglecting my feelings and emotions since the very beginning, to the point where I don't recognise my own emotions anymore. When I made the decision to break up I didn't take into account my feelings for her, how I wanted to help her be her best person and care for her, how much she brightened my life as a whole. When she told me about her dating apps, I was hurting because I felt sadness as she's living her best life without me, I felt anger because I've been left with the mess (paying for the flat myself, living by myself with no support, etc) while she's moving on, I felt regret from the decision to break up with her.  And that's leads to where I am now. I'm regretting that I didn't show her how much I loved her while I had the chance, I'm regretting rushing into the decision to break up and remove the only source of happiness in my life, I'm struggling physically, mentally and financially while I attempt to handle this mess myself. And she's moved on, there's no taking back the decision I made and I'm hating myself for putting myself in this situation. I don't know how to continue living when I have nothing to look forward to as all my days are spent working a job that's killing me or at home rotting and watching videos.",depression,depression,8288.0,0.10116705355835788

I've told her in a million ways and of course she has to tell me that I need to do and get better, but when I was on the backseat of the car I was staring at the buildings on my city to see if they're tall enough to kill me if I threw myself from any of them. Unluckily, they're not.  I've been having an especific plan to kill myself in a especific way for years, since I was a teenager, but I've never gone through it because I don't want my mother to cry.

1750703906,I was productive this weekend but only because I had company,"I had a family member stay for the weekend. I’ve been struggling with mental health for about 5 years now with a few brief stints of good periods. My place had been getting extremely messy as of late. Dirty clothes everywhere. Clothes basket was overflowing. Dust and grime all over. Dishwasher full of clean dishes and dirty dishes piling up on the counter. Empty takeaway bags and containers all over the living room and kitchen.  I cleaned all of it. My floors are dust free, clothes all hung up neatly, bed made, bathroom spotless, dishes put away. Empty kitchen sink. I wish I could have that energy when I’m alone.   I still have this sense of apathy though. Like I was proud of myself for cleaning but I didn’t really do it for myself.  I think the worst part of it all was that I feel they only came to stay so they didn’t have to pay to stay elsewhere because it’s expensive to stay in my city. They were out all evening until 1 am. When I realised they’d be gone for longer than I thought I set up the air bed they brought so the pump didn’t disturb the neighbours and me when they got home. This happened a previous time which is why I expected them to know this time around.   I did some shopping the day before so I could cook them breakfast in the morning. They said no and instead said they want to go out and buy coffee and pastries from an expensive overrated cafe that is popular on social media. They invited me but it just felt like a “we already planned on going to this so you can come or not” invite. I went along just to maybe spend some time. They ordered their food and then I bought myself something. Now I don’t ever expect anything from anyone but this time I at least would’ve liked an offer after I already bought things to cook for breakfast. We had to queue for 30 minutes to get a mediocre pastry and coffee. Sat down for maybe an hour and then they had to rush off to some other event back home.

1750700265,Starting Lexapro again,"Long story short, i started Lexapro back in 2021 and stopped around last November 2024. It helped my depression and anxiety a lot the first 2-3 years up until 2024 where i felt no daily anxiety, felt like i was emotionally regulating more functionally and consulted with my doctor that i don’t think i need it anymore. I went through weeks of withdrawal but overall felt so much better not being on the medication anymore. It helped a lot when i was severely depressed but within that time period i moved to a new city, abruptly changed my whole life and did everything i can to switch up my habits and lifestyle. I definitely can thank Lexapro for helping me not fall off the deep end but a big reason why i wanted to stop was because of how dissociative and numbing it would make me feel half of the time. I can tell when i wanted to cry and release and couldn’t, and especially after i worked out and built a bunch of endorphins i would always break down or feel irritable after the end of a work out. I was finding more cons than pros at that point. I got to know myself as an adult for the first time without medication and learning how to regulate myself without anything “numbing me.”  Fast forward to now 2025, I can tell I’m in a depressive episode again. I can tell I’m starting to revert back to old habits I feel like i cannot pick myself up from. I just learned my mom has breast cancer 2 weeks ago and it triggered so much anxiety and worry in me i don’t have any motivation to do anything else. It’s really starting to affect my work, my relationships and my overall well being. I really really want to keep pushing and uplifting myself but a part of me just knows deep down what i feel is starting to feel depressed again. And it’s getting unbearable to the point where i cry when i first wake up for no reason, and i don’t wanna do anything everyday. It’s been almost 7 months off of Lexapro and now im heavily considering going back on it before this depressive episode gets worse. I really want to be able to help my mom out and be as strong as possible for her. But i am now starting to believe maybe im not capable of that without a little bit of help.   I know this is really long and i appreciate anyone who reads this.. does anyone have any experience of getting back on lexapro after regulating off of it for a while? How do you get yourself back to “normal” after a depressive episode? Any tips on how i can just feel better would really really be appreciated.",depression,depression,2486.0,0.07018469003763123

1750686004,Passive Ideation?,"I saw a new therapist last week, honestly she made me uncomfortable for a moment.  Anyways it was at a low income sketch mental health clinic, that's sliding scale. I went there solely to try getting an adhd Diagnosis. instead they just put me in a room to talk to a therapist, gonna see someone to do a test in like two weeks. But all besides the point.  She asked if I ever felt suicidal. I never know how to answer that, for one never actively, and for two I don't even remember my more depressive feelings clearly.  I've been trying too google, but when you google if you are or not you just get self help alerts on the front page. Anyways, I have thought maybe passive ideation?  Yesterday I spent all work day imagining myself gone, never existed, or if something just happened, just to make myself cry. (Alot of times I make sad depressing scenarios in my head that'll make myself cry, its honestly one of the only times I really feel something. other than rare moments of giddiness due to other things)  Honestly, I don't think I'd even admit that to myself, I know I get wound up because I've seen two many people who use self harm as a weapon, even a bad ""ex"". So I don't like thinking that maybe I'm passively thinking of being gone sometimes. like, I've only ever moved forward, don't think I'd just give up. But sometimes I wanna waste away.  Like, I'm not sure if I even wanna see a therapist there, sure the first 12 appointments i don't have to pay, but I prefer to do my research on who I see, not get like, a surprise lottery.",depression,depression,1544.0,0.03807519640852974

We’re both suffering from depression and anxiety, and are actively seeing a psychologist and marriage counselor. We’ve tried several counselors in the past, but haven’t seen much progress. I realize now that I made mistakes—I didn’t prioritize my wife’s emotions and often blamed her when she needed space. My own family has a history of anger outbursts, anxiety, depression, and trauma, and I’ve struggled to manage my reactions. Our relationship is strained, and while I’ve tried to accept my mistakes and apologize, my wife isn’t ready to forgive me or start over. We bought feel that we might not be good for each other, but we’re afraid of loneliness, societal judgment (especially as an Indian couple without kids), and the responsibilities toward our aging parents. We’re invested in our marriage, but we’re also not ready to let go of the past. At our age, with our mental health struggles, my wife isn’t ready to have kids or to divorce me.

I’ve had a notion in my head since I was 12 that when I turn 18 I am going to finally quit. My birthday is coming up soon. I’ll live to see it but how much longer after that?  This seems like a very worn out story that I’m tired of telling and sick of living. 6 years of this constant miserable cycle. This isn’t even depression it’s just my entire brain. I can’t picture my life without it. I don’t think I will ever have a happy brain, and even if I’m young I can accept this truth. I don’t want to live like this. It’s not mental illness that’s the problem. I am just irrevocably flawed.  I don’t even go into this with emotion but just practicality. It is rational. I have 6 years of prewritten letters all I need to do is become an adult because I don’t want to die a child.  I am currently methodless. I don’t want to feel pain. I don’t think I am fearless enough to jump. I have started thinking of ways to overdose. I think I can slowly steal my mother’s anti-anxiety medication & mix with alcohol. Another method that I was considering was carbon monoxide if I can get the materials.  Anyway that’s it. In the grand scheme of the universe this doesn’t matter at all and I can’t blame people around me for not caring too much. Part of me wishes that someone around me could just hear me. I’ve even tried reaching out and meeting with a therapist and telling my parents and friends and everything but I don’t think anyone understands how deeply I want to actually die.  It hurts so badly to feel so deeply detached from everyone in my life. I can’t blame anyone. There are people who try but I know that people have their own lives to worry about.

1750692316,"57, everything is getting worse, not better...","My mental health issues are complicated. I actually have done a ton of work on myself... been down the antidepressant route, etc. But I don't have some ""chemical imbalance"" depression. I have ADHD, emotional dysregulation, CPTSD from a narcissistic partner, social isolation, work/financial stress... and then the layer of the WORLD AT LARGE stressors. All of this has been going on for sooo long.  My job—which I have managed to hold down for 22+ years—just got HARDER due to a change in leadership, including my direct supervisor. They are all by-the-book folks. Paperwork filled out, leadership, the entire thing. I am not some wall-climbing career woman. I have a lot of things in my personal life I am managing, including a cat colony—which, never mind (someone will just accuse me of hoarding cats, which I am not doing).  I literally have no social life. I am extremely isolated, and even on Reddit my posts are automatically removed, so I can't talk to anyone there. (Oh, and my FB account is requiring me to do some facial recognition bullshit.)  I have busted my ass to change things. The last few years, I have been trying to aggressively downsize, as I have no kids—but that has been hard. I have a difficult partner. I own two houses that—well—they are a mess. Just, plans have not gone as planned, and I am utterly burned out.  I feel that I am doing my best. I am not deliberately malicious. I actually get out of bed and drag myself to work and have hardly ever missed work due to mental health issues—although I was hospitalized a few years ago because I was pushed to the edge and ended up in a 72+ hour hold. I feel I am in that same backed-into-a-corner place and have NO ONE to talk it through with!  The sucky thing is that my supervisor retired, and right in the middle of that transition, my back went out and I lost a week due to crippling back pain—so that put me on the wrong footing with this new supervisor. I feel that lately, anything I earnestly try to do is just sabotaged. I don't really know what to do anymore. I am trying sooo hard... toooo hard for very little gain.  For instance, I spent time trying to get through my clothes and gave a bunch to a friend who had a Poshmark account. She has time to do it full-time, and I made a bit of money from that. I tried starting my OWN Poshmark account, but that has been a failure. Then she decided to go a different direction, and I had to get back all these nice clothes so I could sell them myself (nice stuff—not donate-to-thrift-shop stuff). I feel like all my projects boomerang on me. I try to rid myself of this or that, but it eventually just comes back—or all the work I do gets undone. It is frustrating.  I don't know what to do.

I feel like all my friends think I’m expendable, they never message me and only went to talk to me if I message them. I thought to myself ‘maybe if I don’t message them for a period of time they will message me instead’ but I was wrong. It’s been close to 3 months now and I haven’t heard a single thing from any of them. I feel as if iv been left behind and I know that I should speak directly to them about it but there is no point because for a while when I still talked to them they would either ignore me if we was all out together or use me for things such as stuff from shops if the were a little short, phone chargers, advice, small things like that but over time I realised that they were just using me.  I’m not feeling suicidal, I know that depression can closely relate to that, and that is why I don’t actually know if I’m depressed. I feel like I have just waffled about everything that’s on my mind but i don’t know what to do. I’m so nervous when it comes to talking to my family about the situation and uncomfortable when someone asks me if I’m planning anything with my friends, whenever that happens I always say that they are busy or they are sick.

1750672320,Got the dream summer internship and yet I am totally F**KED!,"I don't know how and where to start, I am writing this post secretly while sitting in my office where ideally I should DO the FUCKING work assigned to me :/  So, I am pursuing the flagship summer internship program at one of the biggest FMCG companies globally for a manager intern role. The pay is literally double of what SWE interns at MAANG earn, and the selection rate in my university was just 5 out of 1000 applications (0.5%)  I got selected for it last year and that was the happiest and proudest moment of my life, my whole pre-final year at university was smooth sailing as I felt sorted for life!  Then came the D-Day, 1 week into the internship and I got so overwhelmed with corporate culture and work that my mental state shifted from fear, anxiety to complete shutdown and depression. I have experienced depression in my life quite a many times since I was a 7th grade student and it's mostly triggered by work stress and people's expectations around.  Still, I somehow continued working on the assigned project made a very slow progress for next 2 weeks, but then suddenly we had an internship mid-review scheduled for the 4th week and I had just understood what exactly my first project is and I didn't even start the second one. My manager, knew about my slow progress, so he reduced my workload but it didn't make much of a difference.   I got depressed again and the mental shutdown occurred just a few days before the review. It was bad, so bad, that I even thought of ending everything at once but a call at home made me stop and I got stable just a day before the review.  I presented whatever work I had done confidently but the leadership team (senior managers) were so disappointed with my progress that they didn't even ask much questions from me and my chance of converting a full time offer just got officially canceled!  At this point I just needed some rest, there was a long weekend so I just relaxed, socialized with friends and family on phone, went for walks, had good food and took some long rest. By this, I atleast got a mental reset.  After advice from family, I planned to give myself another chance for the remaining 3 weeks of the internship. I made a project tracker for next 3 weeks, took some guidance from a good colleague at work and gave my manager another ray of hope.   But, it's just the first Monday of the week and I am back to the vicious loop of overthinking, stress and anxiety. I must complete the work as I am already way behind the schedule but I don't know I am just not able to do things. Somehow I am writing this on reddit, idk why :/  Earlier it was stress, fear and anxiety. Now it's more of a frustration and resistance to do the work.  I feel trapped inside the office, whenever I see any of the senior managers, my heart just pumps the hell out and I become tensed.  This cycle of procrastination, stress and depression has ruined my life before and it has taken its toll on such an important opportunity for me now!   I don't know what to do, I am unable to focus, constantly distracted and anxious throughout my office day. Today is no different.  I feel I don't deserve this opportunity or any opportunity per say. I don't belong to the corporate culture or any work culture and I don't see any other career options.  I am feeling so brainless now, that I didn't even structure this post properly. I am totally F**KED!!!!",depression,depression,3392.0,0.003136363636363626

1750654940,Been single for 9 years and it's causing depression.,"I have been single for the last 9 years going on 10 this November. It honestly makes me feel depressed and left behind. I also feel confused as dating was never an issue in the past. Since grade school girls always had crushes on me or felt really safe around me. I was the guy who always got hugs and when women were at parties or events where they didn't know a lot of people they always chose to hang around me because they felt safe. I have had plenty of GF's in my life and was even engaged to a woman I had been with for seven years. However after that relationship ended women seem to completely change how they feel around me. Most women nowadays feel uncomfortable around me. Women won't engage in conversations with me, waitresses will ask an older or male waiter to take over my table, barbers will suggest a male or older barber even when I specifically booked with them. Women will freeze when Im walking down the street and immediately cross the road before continuing and my own secretary at work won't even speak with me to the point the owner of the company had to yell at her to do her job because she won't tell me anything directly or even acknowledge me when I request something. I really have no clue why this is. I dress nicely, i make in the top 3% of incomes in my state, i practice good hygiene, I'm sociable and make friends with other guys or older people easily. Im friendly, I stay active in communities surrounding my hobbies and I volunteer at several charities. Even animals love me both pets and wild.

1750680376,Depression and Anxiety,"**To All that suffer with Anxiety and depression!**  I just wanted to let you know,  if you are suffering from anxiety,  social anxiety , depression, brain fog, suicidal thoughts- as I did for 20 years please read this.   I suffered greatly from all these symptoms and lost many  years of happiness, confidence  and professional development due to this illness.  I took food intolerance test (York test) which come back showing intolerances to wheat, yeast and other food markers.  I also underwent all available stool tests, colonoscopy and endoscopy through the NHS which showed nothing except diverticulosis.   Even thought I avoided the foods identified in the intolerance test , I still felt the same symptoms.  I have been on many anti depressants like  Sertraline and others, but they only helped  me feel better temporarily and caused additional side effects.  I couldn‘t follow  the same standard approach of taking antidepressants anymore,  even thought my GP constantly encourage me to.  Finally, thanks to my own research, I decided to go ahead and do a private comprehensive  stool test GI360 and Biomesight Test.   I couldn’t purchase it on my own so needed to go through a nutritionist.       Thank God for that, because the tests comeback showing high levels of **Proteobacteria, Escherichia, low levels of Butyrate, Bifiidobacterium, Akkermesia** producing species.     This indicated gut dysbiosis, inflammmation, neurological and digestive symptoms, all caused  by **Yeast, Candida albicans!**  I‘m now on Bi- Phasic Diet, completely sugar-free with supplements  to kill off the yeast and rebalance my gut - and I already  feel so much better.  Please, if you suffer like I did all those years, don’t waste your time.  Get  someone to order these test for you.  Good luck and God bless.",depression,depression,1805.0,0.22858974358974354

A brief relief – and then back to the same reality. And still, I write this now because I don’t want it to end like this.

I'm tired, but not just any tiredness, but one that burns you inside and doesn't go away with sleep or anything. I feel empty, like a part of me has broken and I don't know how to fix it.  Every morning is a struggle to get up. It's not that I'm sleepy or lazy, it's that my heart is heavy, and I feel like the world is crushing me. The days seem eternal and I just want it all to end, but I don't know how to make it hurt less either.  This year has been a storm. I changed schools and with that I lost everything I knew, my friends, my routine, the people who made me feel alive. Before I was the one who animated the group, the one who pulled the size, and now I am a stranger to myself. I feel alone, invisible and afraid of not finding my place.  The worst thing is the anger I feel when I see that no one recognizes all the effort I make. I get up every day and give everything I can, but no one says a word of encouragement to me. It's like I'm screaming into a void, and it hurts me, burns me, and makes me feel more and more broken.  I'm tired... tired of being the one who always helps, of putting on a good face, of being the one who smiles and encourages others, but no one sees what I have inside. I feel like I give and give, that I give everything of myself to others, but when I need help, there is no one who is there for me. It's like I'm alone in this, carrying everything and pretending that everything is fine.  I wear a mask of happiness, a fake smile that I hide every day so that no one notices the hurricane inside me. On the outside I seem strong, happy, but inside everything is chaos: anger, sadness, fear, and a fatigue that crushes me. I feel trapped in that internal storm and no one knows it because I wear that mask that doesn't let me really be me.  It's exhausting to live like this, pretending nothing is happening when in reality I feel like I'm falling apart inside. I would like to be able to show who I really am, without fear of being judged or abandoned, but I don't know how to do it or who to trust with this storm inside me.  It's not just the mind, my body is suffering too. This year I have been sicker than ever, I have had physical pain such as stiff neck caused by constant tension, and I often feel weak and tired. I know it's because all this emotional charge is reflected in my body.  My family doesn't understand what's happening to me. When I try to explain how I feel, they tell me that these are excuses, that I should stop complaining, or that I'm just trying to avoid school. That hurts me a lot because it's not true. I want to get ahead, I want to be well, but I can't do it alone. I feel trapped in a cycle where I pretend to be fine, wearing a mask to hide the storm inside.  I don't know how to express myself well, and that frustrates me even more, but I know I need professional help. I want to learn to handle all this, to feel able to study, to get up every day without that weight on my chest. I don't want to continue feeling this way or carry all this pain alone.

They’ve been my emotional anchor through everything — addiction, mental health struggles, heartbreak. Even just spending a night away from home fills me with guilt, sadness, and anxiety. The idea of being 100km away from them for work feels like losing my safety net.  Part of me wants to grow and be independent, but another part feels like I’ll fall apart if I leave. It’s like I’m stuck: 	•	Stay home = feel safe but stuck 	•	Move out = grow but mentally collapse  I also feel like a failure. I’ve already had 3 job rejections this year. I’m scared I won’t be able to function on my own — scared people will keep seeing me as someone who can’t handle life.  I just want to ask… has anyone else felt this way? Does it ever get easier to leave the comfort of home and still feel okay?  Thanks for listening. Just writing this helps.",depression,depression,1127.0,0.16145833333333334
1750662408,i am a suicide survivor and i'm struggling to avoid the same rabbit hole (TL;DR),"(TL;DR) i (23, F) made two suicide attempts by overdose during my last few years of college. one attempt, only my ex knew about, but landed me in the hospital, and another attempt, my whole family and friends at the time learned about. the second attempt that everyone found about was quite bad and i was put on psychiatric hold for 3 days and medical hold for a week. it was probably the most darkest, isolating chapter of my life. i felt like i had let everyone down. before those attempts, i went through a terrible abortion--i remember passing out on my bathroom floor for several hours and dragging myself back into bed.   i'd hate for this to become a sympathy appeal, but i just do not have the capacity to open up about these things to my loved ones and can't afford a therapist right now--so, i turned to this platform as a last resort because maybe i will hear something that will provide some perspective. even if it's others telling me i'm full of it. to continue providing further context (and in writing this, realizing myself that i've been through a lot, but who hasn't)...   i went through two back-to-back toxic relationships where in both i was codependent on the boys i dated. made a lot of severely fucked up mistakes. hurt them, they hurt me. one of them confessed to SAing me. i got covid several times during college, epstein barr virus, stomach flu, throat infection, and physical ordeals that definitely brought me to a lower point mentally. when i finally started doing better and decided i would not live that way, that i could live, therapy is where i was diagnosed with C-PTSD, GAD, & MDD. i also talked a lot about intrusive thoughts and my impulsive nature, as well as my tendency to get attached anxiously and possibly even disorganized.  flash forward, the last half of 2024 and this year, has probably been the biggest turnaround for me. left an abusive firm, joined a much better firm, regained sense of self and confidence after leaving my most recent unhealthy relationship (been 8+ months of NC), made new friends, met lots of new people, decided on career, did 8+ months of personal training in the gym, ate better, indulged in hobbies again, etc. financially i could be better--but i'm sure as hell better off now than from college/high school/etc. i was on zoloft for several months and stopped a few months ago.   **however... i'm starting to feel that extreme sense of emptiness/doubt/loneliness again which is melting into a cynical view of the world and people again, i am starting to burn out heavily from my office job that's paying for everything, feeling paranoid/distrustful towards people i've spoken highly about, and now... worst of all... major doubt and sadness and hopelessness towards the career i've chosen and am mostly happy about (which is creative, and known to be highly unpredictable/difficult to pursue). i just don't trust anybody anymore, and i feel hopeless despite seemingly having everything i could possibly need to keep going/work smarter/improve my life and myself. i'm getting passive suicidal thoughts again, and i am almost hoping, in a sad way, that i don't make it.**",depression,depression,3146.0,-0.005542604026210582

1750621991,What is considered a suicide attempt?,"Sorry if this is kind of a stupid question, but I had a fight with my friend and we can't reach a consensus, so I thought maybe an objective outside opinions might help. I'm not even sure this is the correct subreddit to ask this kind of thing, but It's the one I feel most comfortable in.  Two weeks ago, I had a really bad episode. In this bad episode, I popped all the antidepressants I had stopped taking (because they were too strong) into my hand, intending to end it all. Just as I was about to take them, I remembered the wise words of Sonic the Hedgehog: ""Never make life-altering decisions after 9pm."" Since it was just before midnight, I decided to listen. I put the pills in a glass bottle and went to bed.  The next morning, I woke up to my period starting, and I felt ten times lighter than the night before. I immediately felt like a clown (like, first of all Sonic of all things stopped me from swallowing pills, and then i woke up in the morning actually excited about life a bit, it cannot get more embarrassing than that). I always forget how extreme my mood swings get before my period starts (likely because of the hormones I’m taking. But both my gynecologist and psychiatrist are currently busy, and I can’t just stop taking them suddenly).  Anyway, today my friend and I were having a deep conversation, and I half-jokingly mentioned this “attempt at attempting.” She didn’t take it well. She started crying and said it was a suicide attempt, even though it doesn’t feel like that to me. To me, a suicide attempt would be actually taking the pills, not just holding them in my hand. It kind of spiraled from there, she tried to take me to the hospital or a mental institution to get checked out, which freaked me out in turn.  We argue a lot about my depression, because when I’m feeling okay, I refuse to take medication or go to therapy. “Why? I’m managing it fine, actually.” But then I go through these intense mood swings right before my period. I only really noticed the pattern this cycle, but looking back, it’s probably been happening for the past six months. (Tbh I'm not sure if this observation is valid, women bodies are weird, and who knows if its hormones are some actual issue). ((Also, the hormones I’m on specifically warn against use during depression, because they can cause mood swings, but first few cycles I've been fine so i stayed on them)).  I managed to calm my friend down by immediately scheduling appointments with my gynecologist, psychiatrist, and therapist, but they’re all a month from now, which means I’ll likely go through at least one more of these mood swings before then.  It feels good to be cared about, but now I wonder if I made a mistake by telling her. While I did really want to die that entire week, especially that night, it didn’t feel like I was actually taking my own life. It felt like I was one step away from that decision. My friend insists I’m downplaying the situation (and maybe that’s true, I do have a history of thinking something isn’t a big deal, only for people to react like it is). So I wanted to ask a more objective audience.  Sorry if this sounds unclear, english isn’t my first language and I’ve been having terrible brain fog lately.

I can’t move out I’m not old enough legally and financially. I tried talking to them about getting a job and they yelled at me and called me stupid for it. They get mad at me for making them drive me around for my sports yet when I don’t train they get mad at me for that. My father threatens me almost every day or anytime he’s upset at me.

My gf was over and my mother came into my room to argue and to force me to train on my rest day. Since I argued she went to my father and complained. Now my father is cancelling everything. I’ve got no where to go. My mother as always been argumentative. She over exaggerates the situation to her liking so she seems to be the victim. My father says I’m sexist for disagreeing with my mother about training today. They yell at me to answer them on rhetorical questions and when I do I get ignored. I’ve started to write down the bs my mother does. I think I should as well for my father. He has messaged me threats while I’ve been across the continent for things I did years ago. And I have the screenshots. They gaslight me into thinking I’m lazy and wrong and the a hole.

I could tell her to stop doing these things that make me curl up in a ball and cry for hours, but deep down I know it's just my overthinking. She tells me everything, is never unreasonable, does anything I ask, she's the perfect partner but I still feel like everything's going wrong.

1750652292,I’m a true burden and don’t know how to stop it,"Some important context, I was born blind. With no family history of any kind of disability, my diagnoses came with anger, sadness, anxiety and a lot of guilt for my parents. It also was a big factor into my sister having to be the definition of a parentified oldest daughter. Because of this, I always felt guilty for my existence. Like my family would be much happier just the three of them. Through out school I was bullied, had an EA, and most of my friends were made out of pity or teachers/parents guidance, my sister resented me (rightfully so), and constant high alert for my mom.  This all played a role in me feeling like a burden from a very young age. That, and genetics, lead to a very rough battle with depression from 11-19. I decided that the only way I could make up for being blind was to be the most extreme people pleasers by therapist has seen.  Well, I went to college at 19 to show that I could be an actual functioning person to everyone who doubted me. Shocker, it was a learning curve. But after five years of living away from my family, and therapy, I’ve been able to come off as a completely “normal” independent person, gain some self worth, and slow down on the people pleasing.   A lot has happened this year, facing a close and DEVASTATING loss. I’ve also been experiencing the worst anxiety/PTSD panic for the last year. So I’ve been very much not myself. Which made me to emotionally shut down.   Because of that, I lost some very important friends to me. In my logical, post therapy mind, this is because of natural distancing due to me not being emotionally or mentally available. But my sad teen brain is reconvinceing myself that I am just a burden. That being a part of my life costs more than it’s worth.  My emotions bubbled over tonight, I had a complete breakdown because of one question.  A friend last minute invited me to go camping. She lives two hours away from me where there is no trains and minimal buses. So my mom offered to drive me half way, where I could meet a bus. But the timing of my friend leaving for camping, and the bus didn’t match. So I was exhausting all my options, one of which was to ask my mom to drive me a little further, where my friend would be able to come meet us while still sticking to a time crunch. Which my mom responded to with   “Why do you always put  this stuff on other people?”  This broke me. Why? Because I’m an emotional person. Probably too emotional lol.  I have not been able to stop crying for an hour, had an anxiety attack, and have a pain in my chest that I haven’t felt since being a teen.  I know it’s one sentence, that my mom thought ment nothing. But that one sentence just confirmed every fear I’ve had for my entire conscious life.   I have no idea what to do anymore that will lessen the burden of my disability on others. I really do try. People pleasing broke my soul, but relying on others is a heart break I can’t explain.   I will never have true freedom in my life, and I will always be a burden.       Idk why I’m posting this, I just feel like it needs to be said “out loud” and I can’t afford therapy.

1750665171,I can’t find happiness,"I’m posting here mostly to vent, but if anyone has advice, I’ll take it.  Life’s been rough since day one. I was born premature, spent weeks in an incubator, and wasn’t expected to make it—but somehow, I did. My parents were both 18 and unprepared, but they did their best until splitting when I was 5. My mom left me with my dad to go live her life. I was really close with my grandpa, but he passed when I was 8—that crushed me and was my first real introduction to grief. I didn’t grow up with a big family: no cousins, no siblings early on, no aunts or uncles I was close with. Just one set of grandparents, and eventually a half-sister when my mom had another kid after I turned 11. But I lived with my dad.  Elementary and middle school weren’t too bad. But once high school hit, everything kind of spiraled. My dad remarried (his third marriage) and brought in a new woman and her two toddlers. Once they moved in, I became invisible. Then they had more kids together. I was so much older than them, we never bonded. Eventually, I had enough and moved out of state to live with my mom. I bounced between both parents, both states, just trying to find some stability.  I struggled with school, got held back twice, and no one seemed to care as long as I didn’t drop out. Somehow, I still managed to get my diploma.  After graduating, I jumped straight into work. I didn’t think college was for me—was never told I was smart, but I knew I could work hard. My girlfriend and I lived with my dad for a while. He charged me $500 a month for my bedroom and kicked us out because I refused to sit in the living room every night for long talks. We had no freedom and were treated like outsiders. Oh—and when he kicked us out, my girlfriend (now wife) was 7 months pregnant.  I used what little savings I had, found a house, and things seemed to be turning around. We had our first child. I landed a solid job at a new mining operation just 20 minutes away. My relationship with my dad even started to heal.  Then things went downhill. I found messages on my wife’s phone—she’d been talking to other men. That nearly broke me. But somehow, we worked through it and even went on to have two more kids together. Around the same time, my dad went through a nasty divorce with his wife, and I drained my bank account and maxed out credit cards helping him pay legal fees. He came out okay, so I thought it was worth it.  Then the mine turned into hell—constant stress and toxic management—but I stuck it out. Until my dad got fired from there too. He moved about an hour away, and not long after, he and his new girlfriend got charged with child abuse for paddling a kid. I dropped even more money for bail and attorney fees. On top of that, his girlfriend took my truck and got arrested 18 hours away—it’s still sitting out there.  He moved in with me while my wife was pregnant with our third. He was lazy, played the victim, and did nothing to help. I finally had enough and kicked him out.  I eventually quit the mine after six years. The money was good, but I couldn’t take it anymore. I found another job—different company, same BS—lasted five months and left. Moved to the nearest city and worked in an auto shop I actually enjoyed, but it couldn’t pay enough to keep my family afloat.  Now, my dad’s back to his old self: selfish, distant, and not owning up to anything. He skated out of the abuse charge with probation (which was fair—he wasn’t involved directly), but he’s still not trying to be better. And now he’s talking to the ex-wife again—the one I can’t stand. Thanks to both of them, I’m buried in debt, stuck in bankruptcy, and just had our only family vehicle repossessed.  I just started a new job again. It pays better, but it still isn’t what I’m worth. My body hurts constantly. My mental state is in the gutter. My self-esteem is gone. I’m exhausted. No one in my family is around. We moved 45 minutes further out and now no one visits. No one helps. No one seems to give a damn. I’ve helped everyone when they needed it—money, rides, babysitting, you name it—but now that I need support, I feel completely alone.  I don’t have friends to talk to. My family doesn’t show up. I’ve got a ton of personal demons that I’m already battling. And the only reason I haven’t quit completely is because I know my wife and kids wouldn’t make it without me.

Moving through day by day slowly, almost like learning how to walk again but tonight is heavy, it’s hard. I feel sorry for myself almost. How can I be so good for others but not for myself.

1750662324,I’m a burnt out “gifted” kid,"Tigger warning for mentions of self-harm and mentions of nearly dying I guess?  Ever since I was young I was called smart. Got the scores, did well in class, liked to draw, was in the gifted program, all that kinda stuff. I was the one who was going to do great things. Someone who had a future and was going to go off and study at good colleges. But in all honesty? I’m just not.  For a while now I’ve felt like a fraud. Like I don’t belong among these other people who did the work to get there. I’m just some kid who got lucky. They have hopes, dreams, plans, stuff that they’re going to accomplish, their specialties. And I don’t. I don’t even really have any big interests.  Every time I’m around people I soon know what their big interests are. Things that’s they’re passionate about and know a lot about and participate in. For some it’s a certain show, drawing, apocalyptic settings, storytelling, specific healthcare studies, history, an animal, a language, just something. And I keep looking for what’s going to be my thing and I just don’t have one. At least none healthy.  As a kid my thing was wolves and dogs. They were all I drew, all I made stories about, all I talked about, and all I wanted to know about. And then when I lost interest in that and refused to even look at them due to a certain type of OCD I had. After that I had an interest in Russia. The country, the language, the people, the culture, the environment, all that. But after the was with Ukraine started, it became hard to keep up the interest.  And since then? I’ve had nothing. I have mild interests in things and be like “this is my thing!” and then burn out of it afterwards.   All I have is good grades, but not much else. I don’t study, I don’t make much of an effort, I just do my work and turn it in and just scroll on my phone the rest of class. How can I feel right being there? I have no passion. I have no interest in the school system and am honestly angry with it. I don’t have a single trait that I can call my own. I have no plans for the future, so much to the point I just picked a random career that I had a mild interest in and talked about that for a scholarship I got. I’m nothing. A nobody.  I’m not even smart, which is the most frustrating part. I am awful at english class. I struggle to read and end up having to reread a lot and am often one of the last people to finished a passage since I read too slowly. I’ll switch up words or just completely misunderstand what a question is asking me or just take it too literally. I can’t “read between the lines”. I have to have the symbolism explained to me and pointed out before I even recognize it. And a lot of the time, unless you have a great teacher, you don’t get taught how to improve or learn the skills you need to be an effective writer or reader.  Math is just asking a bunch of questions and getting reassurance for everything, science I tend to do well with unless it’s chemistry, and history I just plain suck at. I can’t memorize anything and with the way I get taught, it’s hard to even want to pay attention when the teacher praises current failures in society and criticizes past ones. Let alone want to pay attention when they are just reading off some powerpoint they bought and not really knowing a lot of it. If they don’t know, how are we?   I don’t know. I’m burnt out, tired, and honestly a failure so far. I’m not that same kid who had a future. Not after being sent to mental hospitals and having my only interest since then be self-harm. I’ve done a lot of awful things to both myself and others. And yet when it comes to grades? Pretty much dying is a better alternative to getting below a 90. Which ironically is something that could have happened since when I was dangerously close to death, I refused going to the ER due to not wanting to miss the big tests and the end of the year.  I’m just so tired of failing everyone around me. I may be better than I was at my worst, but at least then I had an interest and at least then I had things people could be like “yeah, that’s uniquely [my name]”. Sure it was bad stuff, but somehow that feels better than just being nothing.  I have one more year of school left and I don’t know what to think of it. I can’t handle people seeing me as this great kid who’s going to do great things when I’m just not. I’m just some burnout.",depression,depression,4361.0,0.06120634920634922

1750644808,"I can't believe I share genes with my cousins, and yet I myself am still beyond slothful, stupid, pug fuggly","I’m not even twenty years old yet, and I’m already developing smile lines. Every time I look in the mirror—especially when the sunlight or the harsh bathroom light hits my face just wrong—I’m reminded of the fact that my beauty is already fading. Fading before I even had the chance to attract anyone—man or woman—who might have desired a youthful appearance.  I don’t have any of the truly attractive curves like the other girls in my family, the ones just a few years older than me. They got the good genetics. I got… leftovers.  Every time I hold on to the hope that maybe—just maybe—I could pass my classes, I end up screwing it all up. By the time I finally realize I’m failing, it’s already so late in the school year that catching up is practically impossible. It’s a hopeless, humiliating, and lonely feeling. One I’ve known well since I was eleven.  I’m not athletic. If I run for more than thirty to fifty seconds, my chest starts heaving like some elderly dog that should’ve been put on heart medication five years ago.  Even worse, every time I try to ease myself into a social circle, I seem to be completely unaware of how irritating or uncomfortable I’m making everyone—until someone eventually snaps. And when they do, they don’t whisper it kindly. They bark. “Shut the fuck up and go away.” And then I do. Every time. And I’m left feeling so goddamn excluded—like the other, the outcast.  I’m basically the Pluto of people. Not quite a planet. Not quite part of the gang. Just orbiting in their shadow, invisible, insignificant—always nearby but never officially one of them.  But perhaps the most agonizing part of my entire being is this: I had the potential to be something more. I could’ve been so different. I share the exact same genes as my maternal cousins—the ones who are academically successful, socially graceful, athletically impressive. The ones who have already earned the admiration of the neighborhood like it was their birthright. And here I am. A ghost of what I could’ve been.

1750628361,The Struggle of Letting Go When What Hurts You Feels Like Home,"The reason I’m having such a hard time changing my situation and getting better is that I’m afraid to put so much energy into something I’m not even certain will last.   I think it’s incredibly hard to leave something that’s been with you for so long—even if it’s the very thing that destroys you. Everyone needs a stable anchor, a familiarity they can always return to.  But sometimes this anchor, whether it’s a person or a feeling, though it feels secure, is actually the very thing keeping you stuck—in despair. Most of the time, you know well that it’s the source of your problems.   Despite that, it’s incredibly difficult to let go when it’s the only thing consistently showing up in your life. Once you detach, you’ll feel lost and empty until you realize what you lost was only there as a tool to shape you from the outside—and it was never truly a part of you.",depression,depression,870.0,0.037830687830687826

I’ve always felt like my anxiety and depression have taken away parts of my life I wanted to experience properly and happily.   But instead it just made me come to peace with death.

1750563814,I drowned and nobody knows,"I drowned today.  I faced my fear of water 4 weeks ago, so I'm still a beginner.  I went to the swimming pool for a regular swim. But with the summer days and heat, the shallow pool was stock full of kids (screaming toddlers or rowdy kids playing water volleyball) and their parents.  So I went swimming in the main pool (2 meters deep, 6.56168 feet), like the lifeguard who trains me advised me to.  I swam on my back along the length of the pool.  I stopped near the end of the pool, less than a meter (3,28084 feet) from the pool ladder.  I don't know why but once I got vertical I started to sink, I was halfway down under.  I didn't panic.  And then I felt tired, started wanting for air. I kicked to go back to the surface, didn't work.  I needed to inhale. Silly instinct, I opened my mouth : *then I panicked*.  I spent what felt like an enternity alternating between regaining my calm and panicking when I didn't reach the surface.  I tucked my knees to my chest and wrapped my arms around my legs, because that's how you float.  But I didn't.  Then: -I went into full panic mode,   -Swallowed water 2-3 times,   -Thought about the **crowd** of people around me, sitting in the bleachers facing the main pool,   -Thought someone would notice me drowning (my flailing hands were breaking the surface),   -Remembered the dozen of swimmers around me, and the lifeguards I asked to keep an eye on me,   And a singular idea broke through : **No one is coming to save you. You want to get out of this pool, you find a way to save yourself.**  By that time I'd swallowed a lot of water and it got so quiet.  I swam back so easily. Spent 15 minutes coughing, but was all right. Talked to the lifeguards (they hadn't noticed anything) and went back in the water.  Now it's nighttime and I can't sleep.   I've been through 4 months of (diagnosed) depression: None of the things I hate about myself mattered when I was drowning.  I've spent so many nights wishing I were someone else or that my life would end...  But when it came to it, I was able to save myself. WHEN IT'S SO HARD TO DO IN MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE!!

1750647725,What do I do if I don't want to get better?,"I feel like this is why mental health help has never worked all too well for me, I don't want to get better.   When the psychologist I was attending from ages 11-18 would give me advice or exercises to follow to try to improve my mental health, I never did them. It felt like too much work, it was pointless, or I was sceptical it would work so didn't even try. Things like meditation, writing lists of the small positive things throughout your day or the things you appreciate, exercises based on the concepts of cognitive behavioural therapy, different things. Since I was a kid I was a pessimist and had such a negative disposition and that only got much worse with time.   I don't have dreams, or goals, or ambitions. There is no dream career or college course to work towards, I don't want a partner or to have kids, I don't want to travel the world, I can't even appreciate the little things. I just don't want to be here. It feels like too much work for nothing, everyday it's so hard to force myself to do the basics to stay alive and I don't even want to do them. The fact that my parents take care of me is the only reason I even function this much, which is barely.   I've been so lost and bouncing around, doing different pre-uni courses, and starting a college course, transferring to a different one and deteriorating so much I had to drop out by the end of semester one. I've never felt good enough, I feel like such a damn failure, useless and worthless, so shameful, and I dread catching up with people I used to know  because they'll ask what I'm up to these days? What college course I'm in? And how do I answer that. I have no zest for life, it feels like a burden and I want to go to sleep. I'm not excited about anything.   I've been seeing a counsellor again now at 21, since December but it just keeps getting darker. I've been on antidepressants since I was 15 and they just made me numb, but I feel like they're not even doing that anymore.   I feel truly hopeless and don't understand why people insist I stay. I have a very loving family who care and are understanding, they don't put pressure on me, but I do. They're not ashamed of me, but I am. Love doesn't and can't fix people.   Then a friend passed to suicide last week.   She was a vibrant, kind, welcoming, and just lovely person. I can never know exactly what was going on in her mind, but I know she did 2 one year pre-university courses, and started a college course but dropped out in the first year, exactly what I did. I can only imagine she felt lost and directionless too. I can only imagine she felt worthless too, but of course she wasn't. But that makes me wonder if telling her that would have even really changed anything, because I know when people say that to me I just don't and can't believe them.   But overall I just don't want to get better. I'm too weak and lack motivation to push through and being stuck with passive suicidal ideadion for so long, but knowing I'm too afraid to act has been so frustrating it made me want to get worse so then I least I could go through with it and get out of this limbo because it feels too hard and pointless to claw my way out of this hole for nothing than to just let go.

Dating feels utterly transactional. It's not like I can't find hookups with attractive people, but it all feels so empty. Men are just trading their resources for women's bodies. Nobody is loved for who they are. I miss when I actually had a heart and believed in love. But now I can't unsee it. Might as well use and discard people until the end of time.  I basically am just chasing endless distractions while waiting for my turn to die. Sometimes it helps, at least for a while. In between all the bullshit, I at least can still cherish the moments I have with friends, going to concerts, traveling, gaming, and watching shows on my list. But the feeling always comes back.

My dad is hardworking, spends too much time and money on a fucking disappointment like myself. He wakes up at ungodly hours just to earn money to support the family. I actually want to graduate and get a good course in uni, I want to actually see my dad not having to work hard anymore. I've tried. I've tried to put in the work but my lazy ass cannot. I'm always getting into some stupid game that I've gotten addicted to. I've tried just locking in, it just doesn't happen. I'm known in school as ""the kid who's fallen off"". I used to be one of the smartest. Then after a fail in one test and my grandmother passing away the same day, my life has just took a drastic turn from there. I felt like giving up. I can't tell my dad this because I don't want him worrying about another thing along with money. I'm a burden to this family. If my life in highschool is like this, even if I somehow managed to pass I don't know how I'm gonna do in uni.  I know some of you might not take me seriously because of how fucking stupid this story sounds but I feel like I needed to get this off my chest.

One day I called him and he didn't answer, which usually means he's on the lawn mower or something. So I looked at the cameras and I saw her there...inside the house...I called my dad back immediately and he answered. I said what are you up to he said working on some stuff around the house. I said is there someone there with you? He responded just the cats and dogs. I said oh, because I saw someone on the camera at the door. He paused and said oh the neighbor came up to ask to fix something.......I said huh, alright.....  He lied....right to my fucking face. After all these things he said about how he was happy and glad she was finally gone and all the times she hit him, he fucking let her back against the protection order.  I continued to watch the camera for a minute and he walks out to the camera and points it at the ceiling...we specifically put those cameras up to make sure he was ok and she wouldn't be there, what the fuck.

However, once i got out today they all expressed discomfort and an inability to be involved with me for a while. This was all following a pretty intense manic episode ending in a deep depression.

I've just recently returned to work at 25% capacity after having been on sick leave since spring. I was manic and psychotic. My mental state is still pretty up and down, but at least I'm not manic anymore. It's such a strange feeling being back at work, because the last time I was there, I was completely manic. I left behind a total chaos.  Now, being back, I get these flashbacks from that manic period and they're very unsettling. No one's expecting me to be productive during these few working hours. It's more about just showing up, getting used to the idea of eventually working like normal again.  What also feels difficult and strange is that I work in healthcare myself. My colleagues don’t know about my diagnosis, but unless the doctors and nurses are both deaf and blind, there’s no way they didn’t notice I was full-blown manic. I can tell they know. It’s that classic “elephant in the room” feeling.  And what makes it even harder is that I see, almost daily, the doctor I had a recurring “intimate relationship” with during that time. Back then, I brushed it off as “just a bit of flirting.” But no, what I did wasn't flirting. Messing around with him and giving him a blowjob on the patient examination table is something entirely different. It’s bizarre now. And I’m ashamed. I feel this overwhelming, suffocating shame.

1750767505,advice on mood tracking?,hi - I’ve always really struggled to keep a mood chart despite knowing it’s crucial. I probably would have gotten diagnosed a lot sooner if I was consistent with it. my main issues are:  1) Sometimes can’t easily put my finger on what I’m experiencing until later or until it gets really bad. Days or weeks after it makes more sense to me so I can be like “this week I was generally in this state” and I just write that in my notes app. However the entire thing is disorganised and just reads like the ramblings of someone losing their actual mind. I feel like I’m getting dumber as the years go on and I just have no clarity in the moment of what I’m really feeling anymore.  2) I have to be in a pretty inspired mood to be able to log consistently bc a lot of the time I can’t get anything done let alone track something daily.   3) I really like using Apple Health for everything else regarding my health so I thought that would inspire me but the mood tracker seems really inappropriate for bipolar. Because in my mind “an unpleasant day” implies sadness for most people but for me that could literally be stages of mania lmfao so the whole thing would make no visual sense on a chart.

I haven’t been able to sleep properly for about 6 days now. One night I only slept 1 hour, and today, even after taking clonazepam (Klonopin), I could only sleep for 4 hours.  It feels like my mind and body are in a state of total collapse, but at the same time, I just can’t shut down. It’s like there’s a motor running inside of me that won’t stop, even though I’m absolutely exhausted. What’s scaring me the most is that clonazepam isn’t even helping anymore, like it used to.  I feel trapped inside my own body and mind, incredibly uncomfortable, restless, and desperate. It’s a horrible mixture of anxiety, exhaustion, sadness, racing thoughts, and inner agitation. It’s like I’m both desperate and overstimulated, but too exhausted to function — yet too wired to rest.  I’m not sure if this is mania, depression, or really a mixed episode, but it feels like one of the worst states I’ve ever been in. It’s like being sped up and deeply depressed at the same time.

1750702530,Medication Killed my Sex Drive,"Hey all, I’m hoping to get some advice or just hear from people who can relate. I have both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Before getting medicated for bipolar, I had a very high sex drive—it honestly felt like sex was how I reconnected with my body after years of medical trauma. It was intense, immersive, and deeply emotional. Looking back, I can see that some of that intensity was probably driven by the bipolar and BPD.  Since starting my meds, my libido has basically disappeared. I still get sexual feelings now and then, but it’s not the same. Sex used to feel like an all-consuming high, and now it just… doesn’t. It’s harder to climax, I feel stuck in my head during and after, and I don’t get nearly the same pleasure or emotional connection—unless I’m high, which obviously isn’t a sustainable solution.  The upside is that I’m not constantly craving sex anymore, which has helped me make better choices (especially since I’m not in a relationship and used to jump into casual sex too fast). But I really miss that feeling of connection to myself and my body. Sex has always been a huge part of how I experience intimacy and self-expression, and losing that feels like losing part of who I am.  I don’t want to stop my meds—have helped in a lot of important ways—but I also don’t know if I can live like this forever. Has anyone else gone through this? Did anything help? Did you find a med combo that didn’t wreck your libido or make you feel so emotionally disconnected from sex?  I’d really appreciate any insight or shared experiences.

1750729222,Need support from crash out,"⸻  Over the years, multiple doctors diagnosed me with bipolar disorder—after a traumatic brain injury in a car crash at 16. I had a minor stroke and now live with a metal stent and coil in my carotid artery. Health issues have always lingered like an omen, even though I still party. I resisted the diagnosis for years. Everyone had one—OCD, PTSD, bipolar—it felt like branding. But eventually, it stuck. And so did the meds: Latuda, Lamotrigine. I’d stop, crash, crawl back.  After a brutal move to NYC, life started aligning—cool jobs, writing, friends, stretching, gym, French, travel plans. Everything looked golden. But even with momentum, depression hung and doomed over me in the background—always. Still, I clung to the good.  Then came the festival I planned all year. I go every summer—it’s where I feel free. Last year, I weaned off meds and rolled—mushrooms, molly, ketamine. It was euphoric. I felt like myself again. I wanted that back—just for a weekend.  This year, I tried to be careful. I didn’t want to fully quit meds but still roll. I obsessed—Reddit threads, friends, my psychiatrist (who warned me), my therapist (who said I wasn’t in the best place). I’ve been doing drugs since I was 14. I’m not an idiot. I tried to be smart this time, given everything. Still, I thought: half doses, skip a few days, roll “safely,” restart meds after.  By the time I arrived, I felt awful. No sleep, dissociated, anxious. I cracked and took my meds again on day two. Then I did 50 whip-its, chasing relief. When the tingling in my hands started, it didn’t stop. Panic. My parents think I’m insane for doing whip-its with my health history—and I am—but life is brutal. Sometimes I just want to kill a few brain cells. It’s on me.  I spiraled. Thought I’d caused permanent damage. I canceled the road trip I’d planned all year. Went home. Urgent care, EMG—just nerve irritation worsened by fear. But the mental fallout was massive.  I knew this could happen. I’ve gotten off meds so many times. And I still fucked it up. Now my favorite things are triggers: this place, my car, my fingers. The soul trip I dreamed of became a disaster.  I’m grieving who I wanted to be—free, light, alive. But bipolar, the TBI, meds, self-destruction—have me in a chokehold. I head back to the city tomorrow and I’m embarrassed to even answer, “How was your trip?” I ruined it before it began.

1750735343,Have some questions - recently diagnosed.,"Hey everyone - I’m new to this.  I have a mild form of epilepsy. Diagnosed with generalized anxiety a while ago and of course, depression.  But then it came a bipolar diagnosis - which I didn’t expect but I wasn’t surprised at all.  I hate how easy medicine labels you , but I do understand it does help at some extent.  Now that I’m more aware of my ups and downs, observing myself better on this side.  I can now relate some feelings that I thought were exclusively epilepsy related, to bipolar.

Goosebumps is the least. I feel the rithm and sounds in my soul and my heart starts beating at a sweet spot. At the same time - I believe I have no limits. Those grandiose ideas, that damn… I know they’re fucking amazing - I believe I can do them. Sometimes, sort of my destiny. I absolutely don’t allow myself to think small.   But… I’m very extreme in terms of - I won’t back down. I simply won’t. I will make whatever I put myself into.   The thing is, I know question myself. What I used to celebrate. Enjoy. Embrace. I don’t know if it may destroy me.   But at the same time - I deeply feel there’s no other way for me. And that it’s all or nothing.   I’m deeply into music. Creating things. Tech.  Does this make sense? What do you do with this feeling? People around me, who used to trust me and my ideas - are now hearing differently.   I also experienced 2 psychotic episodes that were mostly triggered by antiepileptic meds.   Apologies for the long text.

Although usually my memory is quite poor between my manic and depressive episodes (not sure if this is normal since this is a recent diagnosis) I’ve managed to keep track of how lonely I feel. When I’m in that state of mania, I have this absolute feeling of grandiosity which can also further be affected by delusions (sometimes religious) making me separate myself from others as I believe they’re not as “good” as me but also in the way that I’ve surpassed what is known as a human  When I’m in my depressive episodes I isolate myself from others but not for the same reasons. I’m way too paranoid, I just believe everything and everyone is after me and that I have no privacy. I guess it’s also affected by thinking about how I may have presented myself whilst I was manic.   Although this does concern me a bit, I understood that this could just be common symptoms of these episodes. My concern mainly comes from how it impacts me outside of this.  When I do eventually have these brief periods where Im not in these extreme episodes, I’ve noticed I still feel lonely. Although I express concern about this, it personally doesn’t affect me too much but it’s more recognising that this isn’t usual. In general I’ve become a lot less social, I can’t really initiate conversations even with people I’ve been friends with for years or even my parents/family. I don’t really care about social contact or relationships as much and honestly it’s made me go from being close friends with people to maybe speaking here and there.   Has anyone else experienced this and if so how has this impacted your personal life? I can’t tell if this is something that can be expected or something more personal to me, either way I’m curious to hear what other people have to say about their own experiences.",bipolar,bipolar,2083.0,0.10736434108527133

When I got the phone call, I was shaking uncontrollably and ended up with a nose bleed. The stress was so overwhelming. Since finding out, she’s started showing signs of intense pain and neurological symptoms.. we’ve put her on a pain medicine that actually has helped her immensely and we’re going to start her on a med to slow down the neurological symptoms which are being caused by her liver failure, causing a build up of toxins in her body.   I have so much fear in me that I’m not going to be able to handle losing her. She’s my best friend. My one constant through the past 11 years of ups and downs. When I’m sad, she’s by my side.

I had a couple episodes and really let him have it, which I regret.  A year ago, I confessed to him that I was in love with him. I was in a manic psychosis episode, so I also told him I was traveling through time. He ended up sleeping with me for 6 weeks. I was in the mental hospital for one week between.  He knew I was in love with him. He knew I was in a bad way.  At 6 weeks, he was acting weird, and I asked him if he had feelings for me, and he said he had only ever seen me as a friend.  This has devastated me.  When I told him I wasn't going to be his friend anymore. He cried, he was frantic, he said, you can't possibly believe I'm not your friend.  We spent the last year trying to repair things, went back to how things were before. That was a bad idea.  I couldn't get over what happened, Id freak out on him periodically. I told him I couldn't do it anymore, because he had taken advantage of my feelings. He ended up crying and saying he did have feelings for me, and reassuring me that he had feelings for me even now. That was strange to me, and I tried not to believe him but it got in my head.  I found out he was going on a date with someone else 2 days later. It hurt and I freaked out on him for telling me he had feelings for me. He legitimately didn't seem to understand why.  He asked me if I was off my meds. And sent me a text saying, ""I care about you. Please talk to your therapist.""  Im torn between feeling like I was justified, and feeling like Im just too much because of my bipolar.

1750708286,Looking for coping advice,"I got diagnosed with bipolar in 2019 after a long depressive episode. I started Lamictal, which didn't work well for me. I was also on Vraylar and Depakote afterwards. I always really struggled with my diagnosis, and any time I would start feeling better, I would just stop taking my meds. Then tell myself I had been misdiagnosed. The two times I have totally stopped meds, I've ended up in a really bad place on both the depression and mania front.  I started seeing my psychiatrist again a couple months ago after I had been having some more intense manic symptoms. Intense irritability and anger, hearing voices when I'm falling asleep, other things psychosis-related like being extremely paranoid, mistrustful of loved ones, thinking I'm being watched, bad panic attacks. Prior to seeing my phych again, I had been off my meds for about 8 months. I have experienced manic symptoms before but they have gotten a lot more severe and distressing over the last year or so. The distressing symptoms come in waves along with feeling GREAT. Like my mind feels unlocked and clear, I feel like I'm able to think and process on a different level.  My psych started me on Geodon, which has helped a bit, but after a bad panic attack they decided to start me on Lithium, and I've been on that for \~2 weeks. After the first 5-7 days, I felt great. Symptoms improved, sleep better. I even journaled about how good I had been feeling. Then over the last 2-3 days, I have gone downhill. I've woken up very irritable and it will border on anger throughout the day. I feel disconnected and foggy, like I'm behind glass. And I'm exhausted.

I know stopping meds has been a bad call in the past, but some of them have made me feel stuck in a gray area. I want to manage it the right way, but I struggle with finding things that work long term, or getting started with healthy habits and activities. After my previous two experiences stopping meds, I won't do that again, and feel like I've finally accepted my diagnosis.  I feel like I've never truly given it my all in trying to manage my bipolar in a healthy way, because once I get discouraged I give up and it falls apart. I don't want to do that this time.

My wife has again been lying to me for the past 5 years.  She got herself in $40K debt. On a credit card, she says. She can’t show me the bills, because she closed the account and has it with a debt consolidation company. I asked how this could happen? She says she bought food, clothes, jewelry. Stuff. None of which can she show me because she pawned it all and got close to the value. This is another lie. Pawn shops don’t pay value. Ever. She can’t answer that to my satisfaction.  I asked about why she needed to go into debt when I made over $500K in the last five years. She said she took money from my earnings to cover her debt. That explains the lack of savings. We are broke. I was so wrapped in my trying to get stable I let the reigns go.   That has to be some fucking debt, right? Where is it all? She can’t tell me in detail what she bought. She can’t tell me how much of our money she stole, for whatever purposes. But she wants forgiveness?  I’m at my mental limit. What the fuck do I do???  She’s risked our home, our kids futures, everything and can’t even tell me how or why???  I want to just go away. End it and let her pick up the pieces. But I can’t. My kids. They need someone they can trust.  I’m making her go to couples therapy, starting this week. I’m going to force her to confront what she did.  I don’t know if 20 years of marriage is enough to save this. I’m working so hard to be better for my family. She’s stealing from us? $40K in credit card debt, but how much of our actual money did she take and spend? I’ve asked over the years why our savings isn’t where it should be. Her answers were very flippant, but I felt that being mentally ill and not as stable as I wanted to be, that I couldn’t really question her.  I’m lost.  My oldest is starting college and my wife has been pressuring her to get a loan she shouldn’t need because I made enough. Thank god I have cash stashed aside to cover the first year. And what I make this year? I’ll put enough away to cover next year. But now I’ll never retire. I’ll be in debt until I die.  What do I do?  I love her, but cannot trust her. I only asked her not to lie to me.  And she couldn’t even do that.  I divorce her? My kids will be devastated. They don’t know what she’s done. They think she’s perfect. They think I’m the bad guy because of my bipolar.  I can’t rip that illusion away. They need to hold onto something positive.  I’m stuck. How do I dig her out of this?

1750655418,If you had religious delusions,"So my whole life before I got bipolar 2 diagnosis I experienced cycles of anxiety and depression, y’know the usual. I have childhood trauma and neglect in my background so I was kinda needy and needing acceptance and validation since I was always so depressed and anxious and didn’t have parents to help me emotionally. But anyway I found a spiritual mentor at age 18 who was a psychic/medium and they introduced me to spiritual stuff and told me I was an incarnated angel and for years up until the age of 25 I believed this and so a lot of my cycles were influenced by religion and spiritual stuff.  I feel like it was good and helped me to cope with the cycles of anxiety and depression I was going through. Like I thought I was an incarnated angel so I made some pretty good decisions I think in terms of not going towards drugs or alcohol. The person acted like a surrogate mother to me as well. Well towards the end of this relationship the pandemic happened and it turned abusive where they were scaring me with the stuff they were teaching and I was terrified and began to have panic attacks and think dark sided things were out to get me (paranoia?). I was saying prayers all the time and having nightmares and health problems. I gained so much weight from it. So anyway, I believe I was in a cult as there were others who followed this person and i came to realize this person wasn’t genuine or “real” in their teachings in that they would mess up details I’ve told them before or say things that didn’t line up so I stopped believing they were the real deal. Anyway it was shocking and coming out of it I’ve been trying to understand this experience and what happened here.   Was I experiencing psychosis? Like is it psychosis to have religious/spiritual delusions about being an incarnated angel. Did I experience psychosis towards the end of relationship when I was having the nightmares and panic attacks and paranoia?   Edited to add: forgot to mention during this time I got 30,000 in debt but they told me the world was going to end and money won’t matter so I went crazy and started a business for crafts and got into palmistry and thought I could switch careers.

1750638934,Taking responsibility of the diagnosis and learning from mistakes.,"Hi everyone, I hope you're having a good day. I wanted to share a story because it's been burning in my mind, I did something that feels like a sin.  A couple of years ago, before I was even diagnosed, I used to party with friends, consuming marijuana and alcohol. This story takes place at the birthday party of an old school friend. That night, we were having a good time—until we started smoking. Suddenly, it felt like everyone became hostile toward me.  At one point, they put a chair in the middle of the room and told me I should sit there. I did, but the chair was flimsy. When I tried to stand up, they insisted that I sit again. I was overwhelmed with negative thoughts, so I gave in—and the chair collapsed. Everyone laughed. But that wasn’t the worst part. They demanded that I pay for the chair and started asking me for money—about 60,000 Chilean pesos.  At that point, I just ran. I escaped through the city and didn’t stop until I made it home. Sadly, it wasn’t the first time something like that had happened but I never saw them again.  The next day, I couldn’t get out of bed. I felt like I should just end everything. I kept repeating to myself that I was worthless and that nobody cared. But I had a girlfriend at the time—and it was her birthday. It was supposed to be our first birthday celebration together. I had prepared a nice gift, but I couldn't even leave my room.  She started calling me, but I didn’t answer. My thoughts were: She deserves someone better. Everyone will be disappointed. This ends here.  Her last message was: “You hurt my soul.” You should know she had also been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I can only imagine how deeply I hurt her. I made those insidious thoughts real. She deserved someone better.  Now, things are clearer. I don’t think I’d make the same mistakes again. I quit marijuana and alcohol. I cut ties with toxic people. I try to be more careful with the ones I love.  Two years after we ended our relationship, we ran into each other in the Santiago metro. I was leaning against the wall with my eyes closed when someone touched my chest. The first thing I saw was her smile. Then she gave me a hug—and I almost cried right there.  We talked about life—about my mom, about her father. When her stop arrived, she gave me another hug and left.  What I did still feels like a sin. But the worst part is, I never told her what really happened that day. I think if we had just talked—if I’d told her about the night, about all the demons haunting me—we could have gotten through it together. We could have celebrated her birthday.  So what I want to say is this: when in doubt, communicate. Even if it’s hard. Don’t let silence destroy the things you love.",bipolar,bipolar,2734.0,0.05997425997425995

It just resonates — and that resonance is sometimes all I need to get through another hour.  It’s not a cure. I still have episodes.

I’ve had OCD since I was around 8 years old and had many depressive episodes in my teenage years (which by the way, I recently found out OCD and bipolar are often comorbid) but started treatment for it only at 16 years old with an antidepressant.  Last year, right before one of the most important exams in university, I had my first hypomanic episode: for a week straight, I could do nothing but study, and a there was a day I studied for 26h straight, no sleep at all. I felt as though I just couldn’t stop, as though I couldn’t do anything else, like it was out of my control. My therapist suspected I had a hypomanic episode and suggested I see a psychiatrist again.  I somehow convinced myself (and the psychiatrist) I was only very anxious about the exam, which would explain the lack of sleep and hyperfocus. She prescribed another antidepressant and suggested we observe if I would get any better and we would regularly see each other the following months.  This week though, shit hit the fan. I could not sleep for the life of me and did not feel like myself. I made a post on reddit I didn’t even remember typing, I got super into coloring books and could not stop coloring for the life of me (I’d never in my life cared for coloring books), could not concentrate on anything at all and basically felt like walking around the house all day to try and spend the energy. A certain day this same week I was up at 2AM and I decided to reorganize my closet? Then I decided to apply for a masters degree in the UK. Just like that. Out of the blue. I even made a list of all of the documents I needed to apply and was going to contact my university in order to get them.   In a brief moment of sanity, I knew this was not right. That was when I knew I was having another hypomanic episode and it was absolutely not anxiety and I needed to contact my psychiatrist.  I talked to my psychiatrist, she took me off the antidepressant and put me on a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic drug and we came to the conclusion this was in fact bipolar disorder. After I took the meds, I finally slept for 12h straight.   The thing is, I have met many, many people with bipolar disorder.

I was having a long lasting depression with severe major episodes between age 15 to 22. Appointments with psychiatrists were fruitless as my symptoms were disregarded. (Eastern bloc country, no noticeable traumatic experiences in my life that could be the cause).  When I was 15-16 I started having severe suicidal ideation (almost 24/7), self harmed myself, tried to commit suicide by my many different ways (no one knows about it).  The depression fluctuated from severe with constant suicidal ideations to mild ones over the course of years.  When 23, because of personal reasons I had fallen into the worst episode yet. I bought firearm, most effective poison available to buy freely in my country and made an appointment with psychiatrist as the last resort before fulfilling my thoughts. Then after the visit in psychiatric office, I got SSRI prescription. After a bad very bad first week I had experienced full hypomanic episode  hypomanic in my case: extremely elevated mood, increased libido, lowered self-criticism, making countless plans for the future, being fully rested no matter how long I was sleeping, taking part in many activities, joking all the time, stupid decisions.  I had a soft landing after one month and then my mind was stable almost to the end of the year.  And then again hypomanic episode, this time there was an early warning: senseless nervousness over little things. After some time I crashed into depression episode big time. It transformed into the full very rapid cycling episodes. For example in hypomanic state: 2 hours of sleep in couple of days, fully rested, working in the office full time.  Rapid cycling  stayed for a long time, after that it went into about 1 month cycles and continued for some time.  Finally in critical mental condition I ended up in psychiatric hospital, where doctors got me off SSRI and gave X drug (to get me out from the depressive episode) and drug Y (to prevent me from having hypomanic episode).  Mechanisms of these two medications worked wonderfully (in a matter of days) and now I am on observation in psychiatric hospital and feeling great. The way drug Y stopped quickly developing hypomanic episode (from drug X) was very noticeable to me.  Being there I was tested for autism and it turned out (the doctor is 99% sure) that I have high functioning autism which caused the depression when I was 15yo (not able to socialize properly with groups and generally being a little bit different caused missing many steps that teenagers and children should have gone thru). It’s a wonderful to finally feel normal.  Remember that my treatment is not a universal way and you should listen to your doctor.  I wish the best to all those who suffer from bipolar disorder.

1750537786,Bipolar ıı,"Hi everyone,  I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder with hypomanic features. I’m not sure if Bipolar II is the most accurate diagnosis yet, but that’s what was written on my epicrisis report by my psychiatrist. Looking back, I’ve felt “different” since I was a kid often paranoid, always scanning people and situations like something bad might happen. I never really thought of myself as bipolar, though. In high school, I constantly felt on edge  irritable, mildly anxious, yet also excited and full of ideas. There was a restless energy that I couldn’t shut off.Things got worse when I was prescribed amphetamines and Ritalin, which I took for about two years. After that, I feel like I’ve never truly come back to myself. It pushed me into a self-destructive, chaotic mindset that I still struggle with today. I’ve self-harmed  I cut my arm once and later tried to do it again, but wasn’t able to because my mom hid everything sharp. I never wanted to die, exactly… I just wanted the noise and confusion to stop.What confuses me most is the emotional swings. I sometimes feel this powerful grandiosity like I’m the main character in the universe, destined for greatness, like I could be legendary. That rush lasts for maybe 2–3 hours. But then it fades, and I spiral into a kind of mild depression  nothing too deep, but enough to make everything feel gray, meaningless, and slow. I don’t consider myself brave. I honestly don’t know what happened to me, or what’s still happening. There’s a part of me that wants to fight, to build something, to get better… but there’s also a part of me that feels broken and confused about how it all got this way.",bipolar,bipolar,1662.0,0.09882352941176471
1750512927,"Been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for seven years, but that might change","I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar for seven years now, since I was 16. When I was first diagnosed, my doctors said it was bipolar 2, but that changed to bipolar 1 after a very severe episode with psychotic features. I had auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, delusions and extreme paranoia. I’m medicated and have been consistently taking my meds as prescribed for five years now! Woohoo!   Anyways, almost every time I’ve had an episode since then, I’ve had psychotic features, mostly visual hallucinations and it’s always the same one - I see spiders. But it’s weird because it’s not like everywhere I go the room is infested with spiders, it’s just that one will pop up here or there and it won’t be real. I always make my friends or family check to see if it’s real if I’m aware I’m in an episode.   Well right now, I’m confident I’m not in an episode. My therapist is confident I’m not in an episode. I have none of my typical manic symptoms with the exception of a weird sleep schedule (I am sleeping though!), but my hours at my job just changed so I think it’s because of that. But for the past almost 2 weeks, I have been having visual hallucinations again. Some of them are the same, I’ve seen lots of spiders, but I also started seeing words on my walls and flashes of light and other things I haven’t experienced before.   From my understanding (as well as my therapist’s), there’s a good chance that since I’m hallucinating outside of a bipolar episode I might actually be on the schizophrenic spectrum, most likely schizoaffective disorder. We’re still trying to figure it out and I have an emergency appointment with my meds provider tomorrow to hear her thoughts, but yeah.   I’m kind of scared. I’ve learned to accept and understand my bipolar diagnosis and I’ve never hallucinated outside of an episode before until now. This information is all so new to me, not to mention the hallucinations themselves are scary.   So I don’t really know what to do or how to feel. I’ve come to terms with my bipolar diagnosis and the possibility of having that change is terrifying. Especially to something I know so much less about.

I've never been manic since I was 17 but get depressed a lot (I debate I was even manic, but that's another story).  I'm an artist (I do photography, draw, write, act, compose music) and I've always been one. When I was hospitalized I felt I changed. It was harder to feel, create and connect with others.  When I was 25 I asked my psychiatrist to lower my dosage of one medication and gradually I did from 600mg to 50mg. When I did I noticed I could be more emotional when acting and cry during a movie. As a result I've wondered what type of artist I'd be without medication. I also wonder if I'd be dead without medication!  I was wondering if there were anyone with this struggle.

I was/am depressed and just thought the change would help.  ok, i'm lying! somewhere in here recently i read the phrase from someone else about 'harvesting mania.' my psychiatrist put me on a low dose of an ssri - i know it sounds crazy, but i am essentially on 3 mood stabilizers (if i actually take them) and we thought a super low dose might bump me out of my depression. me reading about the fires that ssri's can start i thought, why not try and have a little harvest, try and bring back some of that "" good "" feeling i've had before?  well i certainly don't feel good. i'm trying to chock up the loss of sleep to the zoloft side effects. last night i took all my meds because i could feel the restlessness and the REGRET starting to seep in. i didnt' tell my partner and i don't want to because i feel so ashamed and like an idiot. i skipped almost all my meds for 2-3 days (i dont remember if it was 2 or 3) and i'm just hoping that by taking them all last night i can get back on track.  i know skipping meds can be a big topic in here and i apologize for being so stupid and adding fuel to that fire. it never ends well and i just want to get my life back on track and this is what i chose to do instead. the regret is so visceral right now as i sit and watch tv at 5am because i feel tired and wired.  thanks to this community for allowing a space to vent and let this out. you guys all rock.",bipolar,bipolar,1993.0,0.02127192982456141

I had no way to prevent it, and it took another manic episode based around the guilt of the first one to get me sent to a mental hospital where I finally got a diagnosis and treatment.

1750466078,Having a Mixed Episode,Hi everyone!  I am currently experiencing a mixed episode and I need support. I am 21 and my parents don’t even know I am diagnosed with bipolar as I have not lived with them for 3 years. I feel like I don’t have that much support. I am having issues with my close friends and can’t turn to my family. I just feel a little lost.

1750476031,low key coming off my meds,"Look i know it’s wrong. But I was taken off my antidepressant because it made me manic, and now I am predictably depressed. And all my thoughts are just telling me that when I don’t take my antipsychotic, I have more energy and am more cheery and fun. I still take my mood stabiliser every day. I know rationally that coming off my antipsychotic is wrong. The last time I went off it I ended up committing a major crime and went to prison (nobody was hurt) but got a very light sentence after the psychiatric report confirmed it all. For a time after that, I wasn’t legally allowed to stop taking my meds, otherwise I’d be recalled to prison. So I know I shouldn’t do it. I probably won’t do it. It would be selfish. But I’ve started putting two nights aside a week where I do not take them and just enjoy being up all night and not needing to sleep and being in a better mood. I don’t know what to do, I’ve been crying every day and having dark thoughts and feelings, the mental health care system here is a joke so there’s nobody really to reach out to, I’m all alone just as ever. I broke up with my boyfriend too. I hate being the slow, sluggish, fat version of me that the meds make me, but I retrospectively hate what I become when the mania and psychosis set in (I’m schizoaffective).   Sorry for the ramble, I just want to hear from people who get it. I’ve told NOBODY in my life that I’ve been fucking around with my meds. They’d be so disappointed.",bipolar,bipolar,1458.0,-0.0647

I want to go back to school in hopes for a job that would pay better than SSI (if I get approved), and I qualified for FASFA student loans to cover all my tuition in the fall.   My question is, what on earth do I do??? I hate work. I hate bosses. I hate set schedules. I hate coworkers. I just want to work alone and do everything myself. I’ve fallen back on UberEats driving, which I love everything about, but it pays next to nothing. It’s grueling work for very low pay. I just can’t do it anymore. It makes me so depressed. My therapist recommends SSI.   If I go back to school, I would hopefully find a remote job after, and hope and pray I find something that works. But I’m so scared to go through school and realize I hate it too?? I lowkey don’t even want a remote job either. The idea of a boss makes me want to run away.   I do love arts and crafts. It’s my favorite escape. I’ve thought about selling on Etsy, but the competition against dropshipped items just seems crazy.

1750427800,Should I pursue a nursing degree and go back to work?,"Hi everyone! I apologize in advance for the lengthy post.  So, some background: I'm 44F and I've had bipolar, anxiety, and ADHD for 25-30 years, probably longer, but only been diagnosed for 3 years. (Previously, doctors thought it was medicine-resistant unipolar depression.) Once I got my diagnosis with a new nurse practitioner and the right medication (which took a good 2 years to figure out), I felt significantly better. My biggest problem now is that I still sometimes overreact to criticism, like overthink it and have trouble forgetting it, though I bounce back within a day or so instead of being thrown into a major depressive episode as previously.   Since I'm doing better, I'm considering going back to work but pursuing nursing. I've been mostly out of work and on SSDI since 2005. I was able to complete a bachelor's degree in English in the early 2000s with a very high GPA, really I always did well in school, so studying isn't a problem.   My concern is the stress. I know there are less stressful nursing jobs, with fewer hours and dealing with less severe patient health, but I'm still questioning if I could do it. I don't want to get super sick again and let myself or my family down. The extra money coming in would help, but really I'm tired of being home all day and feeling like I'm not contributing or being part of the world. I think with nursing I could really help people.  (Just a few extra details: I got the English degree previously because I'd only recently gotten sick and thought I'd get over the depression fast and thought I'd pursue teaching but ultimately it wasn't for me. But with nursing, I've always really loved science and medicine, so I think I'd really like the work.)   Anyway, I could really, really use some advice from people who suffer from bipolar.

Aside from needing to carry on my back everything I need to eat, sleep, and poop in the wild, I also had to square away my meds and individually dose and bag them for every day. This is partially so I don't have to carry them all the entire time and can leave 2/3 of them with my mom to be mailed later.   To be honest I'm quite proud of the fact that I was in the hospital a few months ago and now I'm setting off on this wild adventure.

1750393827,normal people do not act like this,"I am diagnosed with bipolar, I take medication for bipolar 2. Yet, I do not believe I am bipolar. I know this is normal, even people in the depths of depressive episodes will doubt they're depressed. It's normal. The way I act, however, is not normal.   I'm in a relationship after a year or so being single. A real, genuine relationship. It hasn't been that long, and the time I was alone, I spent it all working on myself. I considered myself a confident person, I thought I was pretty and creative, and someone you'd want around. However, in the few weeks i've been in this relationship, I feel as if all my progress has been undone. He's the sweetest man, and he reassures me he likes me alot. From the get-go I felt he was out of my league. When he called me pretty I'd immediately assume he was lying. I feel worthless, and constantly tell him he could leave anytime he wants. I push and push him away, as if i'm trying to prove to myself that no one can love me. It's a self fulfilling prophecy.   I feel myself making up stories, stories that upset me and stories I fully believe. I feel so ugly despite feeling beautiful just weeks ago. He's not a bad man, and I feel very comfortable with him. When he plans dates, I feel myself dreading it despite really wanting to see him. I just want to cry, im so frustrated with myself. I feel like a burden in his life, and I feel like its only going to get worse. Stable people do not act like this. I'd assume so. I see people in longterm relationships and I just can't phantom it. They could tell me they love me and I'd never believe it. I love myself, I love myself unconditionally but I feel so worthless and insecure in relationships. I feel like im constantly running into walls, and it isn't any better that my therapist ghosted me. I just feel stuck. Why do I always self sabotage in relationships. Why do I feel so miserable despite begging for a relationship. Why can't I just fucking appreciate what I have.  I guess im just wondering other people feel like this too.

1750415703,Bipolar Love- trying to find closure,"I’ve just been broken up with by my girlfriend of almost 2 years. Mystery illness flared up a few months ago and my health has been in decline since. Mood has remained more or less stable through all of this. Despite the physical pain and challenges I still value my independence even at its worst.  A few weeks ago I started focussing on my own goals, hobbies, and future career. On the medical side I’ve gone through countless tests to narrow it down and the last piece of the puzzle is an mri. The test hasn’t even happened yet but worst case I have a brain tumour or something like that. Whatever the result is I’ll finally have some structure moving forwards.  Prior to all of this my now ex girlfriend was going through her own issues with mental health, employment, discrimination, financial instability and bad reactions to medications. This was maybe a 6 month or more period where I was there for her every day. I won’t go into detail but some of these times were really hard, more than most could handle alone.  This last week I finally felt like everything was good again. We were both leaving behind a very rough start to the year. Then all of a sudden mid conversation talking about our future and joking like we always do it just happened. She said she was done. The stuff with my health was one of the main reasons and that 6 weeks ago “the feelings just went away and didn’t come back”.  I’ve been trying to wrap my head around it. She says not to blame myself but part of me wishes I’d actually done something wrong. I could at least understand if the mri said I had a brain tumour and 3 months to live but the test hasn’t even happened yet.  I’m just questioning if the relationship was more one sided than I thought it was, or if her own stress/bipolar carried the emotions, or if the stress of this year just caught up with her all at once. I don’t know. I’m past the point of asking for answers. I just want some personal closure and some idea of where to go from here.  TLDR: gf broke up with me after health issues appeared.

1750387733,Worplace harrasment due to bipolar,"I work in a bank in an Asian country where I was required to disclose my bipolar disorder due to internal policy and in hopes of accessing reasonable accommodation, as allowed under national guidelines. While I have been managing the condition well under medical supervision and have consistently delivered good work, I’ve been facing repeated workplace harassment since this disclosure — especially from HR and senior management.  In meetings meant to discuss my KRA or role adjustments, the conversation is frequently derailed by inappropriate and mocking remarks about my medical condition. For example, a senior manager often asks,  > “What even is bipolar disorder?” “Is there any blood test for it?” “Why are you asking for backend roles? It’s just a normal issue — others have worse.”    They compare my condition to someone working with kidney failure, as if my request for accommodation reflects laziness rather than a legitimate need.  Most recently, I was publicly questioned in front of my colleagues by a Regional Office official. They asked for the name of my disorder, whether it could be diagnosed through a blood test, and then implied I was “hiding behind it” to avoid work. I explained politely that diagnosis is clinical, based on evaluation — not through blood tests — but that was met with disbelief and sarcasm.  Despite my efforts to remain professional, the constant emotional targeting has created a toxic and unsafe environment. I feel like I’m being punished for being transparent about a medical condition that I never asked for. I freeze whenever they start questioning it — and that inability to immediately defend myself is seen as further “proof” that I’m at fault.  Due to financial responsibilities and current economic conditions, resigning is not an option for me. I have loans and dependents. I want to keep working and contributing meaningfully. But I’m deeply exhausted from feeling that requesting reasonable accommodation equals weakness.  If anyone has faced similar experiences — especially in bureaucratic or corporate environments — how did you cope? Did you escalate the issue, or find informal ways to protect your mental health?",bipolar,bipolar,2177.0,0.0313131313131313

Three weeks ago I had a psychotic break after two days without water and food while in the emergency department, 6 days of liquid diet after that, 1 month of no social contact because of being confined to my apartment due to pain, being forced to drop out of school because of this, losing 12kg (26lbs) in a month and my mind shattered.   All I did for weeks was hallucinate sounds and shadows, cry and didn't trust anyone. I thought my friends were leaving me forever and I apparently lashed out by saying some awful things. I don't remember much but I know it was BAD. Now I have no friends, I'm in constant pain and I'm not allowed pain relief meds because of the mystery disease (bad reaction).

If there's a hell and individual punishments mine will be being back in my old apartment alone for eternity. Ending up isolated for a month made me feel like I was back there again and it broke me.   I can't fix any of the relationships I destroyed and I have tried in a respectful manner but no one wants anything to do with me. My best friend said that she doesn't think I'm a bad person but that she'll need a lot of time to think and I'll honor that.

At that time I was on medication. Unfortunately I became too anxious to get my prescriptions refilled and I started going downhill fast, I started thinking if I hadn’t gotten this fixed by now then I should just accept that I couldn’t, and I was being selfish by wasting resources that could be better used by someone who was actually capable of getting better.

1750348750,I can't tell if my behavior is due to my circumstances or not.,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 6 years ago and as I've gotten older my episodes have gotten worse. I've recently been through a lot of difficulties including a pretty bad depressive and mixed episode around 3 months ago that left my life a bunch of pieces to pick up and work around including wrecking my car, not having a way or ability to go to work both mentally and with lack of transportation and lack of support.   I want to preface this by saying I am also diagnosed with adhd so I think these could be just impulsive decisions from adhd and not impulsivity from incoming mania.  Recently I've been able to be approved for a credit card and was able to drive my car again for the first time in 4 months and didn't think about leaving most of my things at my friends house and took my car directly from the shop that it was approved to drive at and drove it to where it was getting fixed fully in a week and a half(location H). I was also praying out loud somewhat sarcastically but also genuinely even though I don't believe in God and haven't since before I was diagnosed with bipolar before they told me my car was operable again and tattooed a small cross on myself and now it seems like God is real and was listening to me. I saw a rainbow yesterday when walking in the rain and it seemed auspicious but I don't know if thats magical thinking or just luck and circumstance.  When I drove my car to location H a week and a half early I did so knowing that I had people in the area I could stay with if needed that are somewhat found family/older friends that look out for me and my friends, but I didn't want to call so I stayed outside in the heat just smoking until I saw someone else I knew on her way home from work and she invited me to her house. I used to work with her but didn't know much about her aside from bumming me a couple cigarettes and her reputation as a crackhead but she gave me dinner, a good conversation, and some alcohol for almost 4 hours until maybe 1130.   I felt wired and tried to sleep in my car but my phone was dying so I went to a 24hr place I could charge my phone at and texted my friends until 1 when my friends in the area texted saying they couldn't sleep and wanted to pick me up so I went there and could have slept on the floor but just read and smoked until it was around 630 and then tossed and turned until 10. I'm feeling kind of wired but I'm also a bit tired and usually I'm not tired with mania.

1750350682,Lack of routine due to public transportation,"This is just a rant about how difficult it is to have a consistent routine, and how it contributes to stressors that I think are causing episodes.  I have a disability that impacts my mobility. I presently do not drive because of this, so I rely on public transportation. Before it was the bus, now it’s a paratransit service.  While the paratransit service is amazing because I don’t have to worry about making transfers like I do on the bus… there’s no consistent schedule.  I work from 8-4:30. To get to work at 8am, some days I get picked up at 7am and some days I get picked up at 6am. And to leave work at 4:30pm, sometimes the pick up window is 5pm-5:30pm, others it’s 5:45pm-6:15pm.  But because it’s rush hour at that point, they’re consistently late.  I might be the first or the last to be dropped off. Yesterday I was picked up at 6:15am for work, then at 5:15pm to go home, but I didn’t get home until 7:45pm.  I try to make the most of it. Often I get to work early so I’ll go on a little walk. There’s a gym on property so if it’s a late pick up, I bring clothes and do that. I can track where the van is online so I at least am not waiting and doing nothing. I also have work for my graduate program, so I can study. I meal prep and have a chore chart to mitigate the issues that arise from being out of the house for so long.

1750369672,re: yellowjackets psychosis?,"so i made a post a couple weeks ago about how the show yellowjackets has been affecting me. a couple people told me to tell my psychiatrist, and i did, but she brushed it off and said it wasn’t anything. i haven’t stopped what i was doing. i still feel like talking to lottie genuinely helps me. it feels like praying to some sort of god, just substitute god for a fictional teenage cannibalistic schizophrenic cult leader. (i should probably add that i’m not otherwise religious; i’ve been an atheist since i was about 15). so, nothing has really changed on that front. but lately a lot of the food in my house has started going bad. like, a suspicious amount. the milk is spoiled a week before its expiration date. lemons and limes are rotten. eggs go bad fast. even the jar of olives i bought was full of mold. our fridge works perfectly fine, for the record. my spouse says it’s just because of all the food restrictions that have been rolled back, but it feels like someone is out to target me directly. and i can’t help but relate it back to yellowjackets, where all their animals died and they had no more source of food. but the thing in that instant was that they killed the animals on purpose to initiate a plan. all that to say, now i’m basically paranoid that someone is tampering with my food on purpose somehow, trying to make me sick. does any of this make sense? i now have a new psychiatrist and i have not mentioned any of this to her yet (since what i told my last psych).   reposted",bipolar,bipolar,1502.0,-0.05053597196454339
1750355280,I’m so frustrated seeking diagnosis,"This is my first time posting in this subreddit but i’ve been lurking for a while. I’ve been really struggling with my mental health for the past year and have had so many different doctors tell me different things and I’m struggling to find the right doctor/diagnosis, and it’s so frustrating   In February of this year I had to spend some time in inpatient care. I was diagnosed with MDD and put on anti-depressants for the first time. I’m not sure if i’m supposed to name the medication so I won’t but it is one that is known to trigger mania/hypomania. A month after I started that medication I started experiencing what could have been mania. I had a psychiatrist but it took me a couple months to become aware of the behavior so by the time i brought it up with her it was my last appointment with her because i go to college out of state and had to return home. She put me on a medication to help anxiety at night and help me sleep and I haven’t spoken with her since because I’ve been in a different state.   When I returned home I had an appointment with my PCP, she told me about the possibility that I am bipolar or at least experiencing hypomania due to my antidepressants. She urgently referred me to a psychiatrist at home and I finally felt like I was getting somewhere. But the psychiatrist refused to schedule me because I wouldn’t be in state year round.   I finally got an appointment with a NP to evaluate my medication. I felt like the np didn’t listen to me and he kept talking over me.. He ended up increasing my dose of the same antidepressant and put me on a medication that was only for sleeping, even though I tried to tell him I didn’t feel like i needed help with sleep.   I’m just so tired of telling my story and being hit with roadblocks at every turn and I feel like no one is going to listen to me. I honestly don’t have the capacity to continue advocating for myself and there’s no point in trying to get scheduled with another provider before i return to college.",bipolar,bipolar,1999.0,0.01350931677018633

1750327797,Does my bipolar make me more spiritual — or am I getting lost in it?,"Hi everyone, I’m newly diagnosed with bipolar (though I suspected it for years), and I’m just beginning to understand how it affects my mind, my relationships, and especially… my spirituality.  I’ve always been spiritual since I was a child — drawn to energy, deeper meaning, nature, the stars. But when I’m in what I think are my manic or hypomanic phases, my spirituality becomes intense. Like obsessive. I crave deeper talks, I feel high on meaning, I feel like I’m more connected to the universe than most people, even a little egotistical. It gives me this rush. And then when I crash, I question everything — was that all real or just part of the episode?  Another thing: I’ve developed what might be a “favourite person” — and he’s not my boyfriend. He’s someone I became close to through my boyfriend (they went to uni together), and we connected deeply, especially through spirituality. He’s also in a relationship, and I would never cross any physical or romantic boundary. Our friendship is very pure. But I still feel guilty, maybe because society makes it seem like girls and guys can’t be close friends — especially when you’re both in relationships.  My boyfriend is loving and amazing in many ways, but he’s not spiritual. He also struggles to emotionally support me during episodes, which is hard because I’m new to managing bipolar, and he’s new to understanding it too. During my worst episode, I was clinging to life emotionally — and this other guy was the one who saw me. He was calm. He made me feel safe. My boyfriend wasn’t there emotionally, and that really hurt me. I still carry some anger toward him for that, even if I don’t want to.  So now I think this guy became my “safe person” — not romantically, but someone I deeply emotionally attached to. When we talk one-on-one, it feels different. Real. Like our souls are having a conversation. But when we’re in a group, he’s different. And I hate that I only feel this closeness when we’re alone — it feels like that’s crossing a line, even though we’re not doing anything “wrong.” But why do I crave that one-on-one time so badly? Why does it feel so emotional, when there’s no physical attraction?  I’m also waiting on an ADHD diagnosis, and I know I talk a lot — my boyfriend tries to be supportive but I think he gets overwhelmed. I just want him to feel safe and seen too. I don’t want to break anything.",bipolar,bipolar,2388.0,0.04007599284773199
1750323806,I made this late at night in a manic episode. (light trigger warning),"Have you ever wondered how it would feel if almost no one understood what you are?   Have you ever wondered how it would feel to have even people with the same problem not understand?   Well, look no further than Bipolar Disorder, where every case is unique and has more range than any singer can ever have.   With Bipolar Disorder, you can experience life in new and fun ways!   Such as life being a roguelike, with every day being a new run of emotions, motivation, and impulse control.   The absolute worst combinations to have almost no control over!   Others might experience it in long, drawn-out swings.   Others might have it feel like an amazing drug with some withdrawals.   And don’t think all three stats stay close to one another!   One of the scariest things is low emotions, high motivation, and no impulse control!   So if you ever think a bipolar person can just ignore their disorder, you are sadly mistaken!   Some lucky people don’t have it as bad as others.   Some only experience it once in a lifetime.   For the unfortunate lot, it's a daily struggle.   Bipolar Disorder is a battle with yourself that can’t be won, only stalled.   Many people lose the battle.   Others have an easy time keeping it under control.   It isn’t easy to seek help when medicine reacts differently per person.   The worst part of it all is no one takes it that seriously.   It can even be as serious as some major disabilities.

1750260229,Can bipolars drink alcohol,"Hey guys, a while ago I posted a post here from my old account asking whether alcohol affects us (those who are diagnosed with bipolar) differently in worse ways than others who aren’t bipolar.. , back then I was going through my worst year and I was spiraling out of control and almost lost my life multiple times literally! :)   The reason I posted this in the first place was because I was connecting all the disasters I was making to me being bipolar.. but then I realized that 95% of the chaos I’ve caused was when I was under the influence of alcohol… so this is when I got curious. Even though my psychiatrist told me it’s not related and I should just not cut off my medication and be consistent I couldn’t help but think that there must be some connection because literally almost all my regrets were related to stuff I did while I was drinking, I almost reached to a conclusion that maybe it’s just me and alcohol is basically not for me but regardless I posted to see whether anyone had similar experiences.  After I posted, the post got a lot of comments where people shared their experiences and to my surprise ! almost everyone agreed that alcohol definitely affects us in much more severe ways and makes do so many things that we regret later on . After reading everyone’s experiences I’ve literally never related to anything more in my life ..just seeing the amount of people that went through so much problems and self destruction because of alcohol, made me realize that yes alcohol does affect us in much worse ways, triggers our splits .. makes us go manic in a second and then we feel the guilt and the pain and not understand how could we have possibly done such a thing   To everyone who commented on my previous post and shared their experiences, I want to thankyou from the bottom of my heart, because you all saved my life ( truly ) ! .. because of your comments I decided that I’m quitting alcohol and never touching it again. It’s been 4 months now since the last time I drank and let me tell you guys it’s the best decision I’ve ever made !   My relationship with the best person improved so much, my confidence became higher, i even started seeing a different psychiatrist and my medication doses finally got reduced! I can sleep sometimes without sleeping pills, my reputation is finally getting better because unfortunately I did so many mistakes that would make anyone not consider me a good person or even a normal person to be around. I was unfortunately relying on alcohol so much that I forgot how to socialize or enjoy my time if I’m sitting with people who are consuming it .  But let me tell you, before I would mostly drink socially when others are drinking but my nights would  always end up with disasters because somehow I always ruin something.. right now I just pretend that I’m drinking or sometimes I even don’t have to I simply say I’m not feeling like drinking today, my friends and boyfriend don’t fear me anymore, I’m not a liability to anyone like how I used to be .. I can’t DESCRIBE HOW amazing I’m feeling !!!   I won’t deny it was definitely a bit hard at first but I swear to god that the comments I read on my previous post were such a great motivation and that’s why I wanna say thankyou once again!

That being said, I'm going to college in the fall and I know that I should probably tell my roommate that I have bipolar since it could potentially effect them, I'm just really scared of ruining their opinion of me before we even know each other. I've been in situations were I've told my friends about my mental issues and had them chalk up all of my actions that they disagreed with to my bipolar and it lowkey killed a good couple of relationships.   I have ""mild"" symptoms compared to other people I know with bipolar–never been hospitalized, most people I know say they never noticed anything (including my parents)–and treatment has been helping a lot I think, but I've had episodes of (what was likely) psychosis before and I don't know if I want to risk rooming with someone without giving them that context.

This is the third time in the last 5 years I've been told that I'm bipolar by a professional. The first two times I didn't like the doctor so I simply didn't believe them.   I went to a new psychiatrist today who actually listened to me fully and then was able to repeat what I told her verbatim to make sure she was getting it right. At the end she told me she is confident that I am bipolar. She initially said type 1 but later said my symptoms present in a way that is also consistent with type 2 so it wasn't super clear.   I talked with my partner after the visit and immediately they said they don't think so. I should mention that my partner has previously worked in the mental health field as a diagnostician. They don't think I have mania that falls into the criteria for a bipolar diagnosis.   I also talked to my mother, which was a mistake, but I wanted to let her know as it runs in the family (I have two aunts on her side that are bipolar.) She proceeded to tell me she also doesn't believe the diagnosis because I don't seem like my aunts where I'm ""in a psych ward screaming at people"".   I don't understand how three separate, unaffiliated psychiatrists over the period of 5 years can all come to the same conclusion if I'm not, in fact, bipolar.   I am so frustrated at my family, because yes, I am pretty well put together and I don't have a lot of emotional outbursts (anymore), but that doesn't negate what I've been told now THREE times.

My mom is convinced it skipped her, which is laughable if I'm being honest. She just recently started going to therapy because of an incident that happened at her job.

1750267341,Thinking of admitting myself but really scared,"Short version: I haven’t done any SH or had any attempts in a few months so I’m not a danger to myself. I’m diagnosed BP-1 ADHD and strongly suspect ASD. I am medicated and never miss a dose.  I’m looking for information about admitting myself into the hospital because I’m terrified and confused and have no idea what I should do.   I’ve had a horrible year, like really bad. I’m still employed and married (barely). I think I need more help than the people in my life are capable of giving me. My wife is amazing, I honestly don’t know why she’s still with me, and her mother (also an awesome person) will do anything for me but just can’t relate to what it’s like to be bipolar. I’m in good standing at work, but my job is very demanding and stressful and I have multiple employees that depend on me. I can take two weeks vacation but really don’t need to be off any longer than that and I’d rather not tell my employer why I’m taking off, just that I’m going on vacation.   Really I’m just wondering what it’s like in the hospital and is it worthwhile to go if I’m not a danger to myself. I’m just rapid cycling like a mf and completely mentally and physically exhausted. Also, I have four children that I would be lying to and am not at all crazy about that. I could possibly talk to my 22yr and 18yr old sons about it but would rather not. Both of them know that I have some mental issues but not the extent of it. I’m completely transparent with my wife and mother-in-law so they’ll be there for me.   This is absolutely terrifying because I’m the one that is supposed to solve problems and support everyone and be there for them and now I’m losing my shit and can’t fulfill that role.  I feel like I’m spinning.   My wife and I are going to see my therapist tomorrow (scheduled appt. Not emergency) to talk about childhood SA for the first time so maybe this is me crashing out over that but I don’t think so.   I know that this is probably so poorly written that it’s been hard to follow so if you’ve made it this far and have any advice on admitting myself and what to expect once in the hospital or really just anything encouraging to say please don’t hesitate.

1750265234,Distorted face during a manic episode? (Repost),"**Reposting because the original one mentioned something going against the community guidelines (sorry mods). Original comments suggested it could be psychosis or dissociation, I have already contacted my psychiatrist and had an appointment set for next week regardless**   I think I’m experiencing a manic episode.  The past week or so I’ve been incredibly angry. Little things set me off. I’ve been incredibly rude to people when they piss me off - including customer service workers which I NEVER do - and I’ve fantasized about screaming at some coworkers who admittedly have caused me a lot of stress and emotional distress. I am noticing having more energy despite not getting enough sleep, but I followed the protocol set forth by my psychiatrist to help me sleep last night and will continue.  Yesterday I was FaceTiming a friend, though, and when I looked at my face in the little square it just looked different. I even expanded it, and the more I looked the more it morphed. It started with my jaw looking uneven, and then my right eye looking like it’s drooping, and then the right side of my face looking…weird. Like it was being viewed through a wide angle lens. But only that side.  My vision got kind of fuzzy and I felt odd. I shared with my friend what I was seeing and he told me I look normal and symmetrical. I didn’t believe him because I knew what I was seeing…  It looked normal later that day. Even later in the call.  I experienced something like that before, a few years prior to my diagnosis. But I definitely had bipolar disorder back then, just wasn’t medicated at all.  Has anyone experienced this? Is it a visual hallucination? I think I had auditory hallucinations when I got diagnosed. I told my psychiatrist about it. It’s like I would hear whispers and talking in my apartment when I was all alone.",bipolar,bipolar,1833.0,0.08028711484593838

I went, waited 5 hours before being told to go home and the crisis team will call this week. They did and now I have an appointment with their psychiatrist next week.  The public system here have decided that I have Borderline Personality Disorder instead of Bipolar, even though my diagnosis has been confirmed by 2 separate private psychiatrists - my psychologist who know me very well also agrees with the bipolar diagnosis. Because they think I have BPD, they just tell me that I need to do more DBT (event though I've been working with my therapist on DBT stuff for like 7 years, and did a 3 month stint in a private facility that was very DBT heavy). So I'm nervous that the doctor at the appointment next week will just go with the BPD thing and not listen to me at all.

That said, I cannot shake this fear that the rest of my life is going to be remarkably consistent. Same career for 40+ years? Same relationship for 60? The thought of spending way more time than I have even been alive for doing the same thing with the same people seems terrifying.  I have gotten much more stable than I used to be, but I miss the thrills that came with uncertainty. Hypomania is so addicting that I almost forget the depths of depression I would fall into. I got to the place I wanted to: somewhere in the middle where the ups and downs are less severe. It's hard to be happy because as long as I'm stable, everything feels so subdued. I think it would be a terrible decision to throw away what I've built and how far I have come, but the urge is there. I want to make bad decisions and chase everything that glitters. How does anyone avoid monotony in their life? And how do I feel happy in a good life when - even if it wasn't sustained - I have felt happier in a bad one? I want to be happy in this life, but I don't know how to.",bipolar,bipolar,1512.0,0.08872549019607848
1750203854,How to survive ??,So basically since the first week of April I’ve been feeling better but then better and better and then like I stopped sleeping or eating first week of may and went insane because this rotisserie chicken told me about how to have a child to save cancer and  then the universe was guiding me and also the fbi wanted my skills but I realized I was wrong and all of that was funny delusions so I’ve been better since right though my music career might still succeed I guess we’ll see? But I never crashed and felt lucky and I ate a bit but I still keep staying up every night driving and dancing but felt fine so it was fine but it’s still going and my body is sore and my mind is falling I can feel it and I know it now I’ve been wrong about being better because then I ran away and was fighting with family just a little b it but staid back and it’s fine. anyhow I’ve been hanging out and making friends with coworkers it’s so nice so even better but here’s the problem: I’m starting to like float and my feet feel fake and like I think the sleep may actually be getting to me because I’m fatigued and I can feel the stupid. My ears are like hearing the air loud But now I’m leaving town until Friday so how do o survive or get through until Friday? How do I pass as normal and just be ok? What should I do then? I tried to nap off the tiredness but failed— it looks like I’m tired too I think because my thoughts have gone so fast and hard they like hit a wall ?? And I’m spacey anyhow help and lmk thanks hospital or er is not an option I can’t do that 🙏 this all started today btw even last night I was just happy without being tired with no sleep— will caffeine or coffee work for now?

1750211716,Gender euphoria or hypomania?,"Hello! I'm having trouble figuring out whether what I experienced last month was just gender euphoria or if it was a hypomanic episode which intensified the gender euphoria.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder twice. The first time was last year, a few months after I had a psychotic episode. Then I switched psychiatrists, and after 10 months with him, he gave me the same diagnosis again a few weeks ago. I really denied both diagnoses, thinking I'd never had a hypomanic episode, until I started researching the disorder more deeply and recalling some things from my past, especially from last month.  I'm non-binary and have thought about transitioning and stuff. But in the first week of last month, I experienced a really intense euphoria every second I thought about transitioning, about being a woman, having breasts, and so on. I was searching about transition and HRT for hours. I decided I was going to start HRT and change my name. I was really sure I was going to do this. I even made an appointment with an endocrinologist!! It was the happiest moment of my life. I can't describe the feeling. It felt better than any drug I've ever used.  I wasn't thinking about the consequences of transitioning, nor considering that for a lot of reasons I couldn't transition right now. In the second week, I felt good but thought less about transitioning, and whenever I did think about it, that feeling of extreme happiness wasn't there anymore. When I use makeup and feminine clothes, I feel good, but I can't even say it's gender euphoria. I still think about transitioning and stuff, and I feel happy about it, but nothing like that ecstasy feeling.  Also, I really believed my depression was cured, but it's back. When I was feeling good, I started some projects that now I don't have any motivation to pursue. At the end of last month, I had three days of pretty bad insomnia, and I got extremely irritated by any stimulus. My mind was racing, and I felt very agitated, anguished, and depressed.  Other things I realized: last month I spent money like I'd never done before (now I'm short on money because of that), I drank a lot compared to previous months, and I smoked a lot. I used LSD too, which was a very impulsive and stupid idea because of my previous history of psychosis.  So I'm trying to figure out if that was only gender euphoria or if the other things I've mentioned contributed to the idea that I was hypomanic. Has anyone had a similar experience being bipolar and trans?",bipolar,bipolar,2500.0,0.10340743440233238
1750224138,"Am considering trying to become a public speaker, would like advice.","Hi! I hope this is the right tag for this topic. I would like some advice on this though.  In 2020 I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, and then later re-diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I’ve engaged in some very destructive behavior to myself and others that I won’t overly detail here, as I don’t want to trigger anyone. I was in a toxic relationship for a long time, and have had some very low lows, with psychosis and other things included.  On top of this, in a manic episode I broke my back, and it was a long and severe recovery process.   I had self destructive behaviors in high school, and struggled with a severe eating disorder from the time I was 12-19.  This is only part of my story, but my story ends well.  I graduated with a bachelors degree last year, and am working on a masters degree in public health. I work full time, support myself, and am paying my way through my master’s degree. Due to family support and access to healthcare and medication I have been able to manage this disorder.   I want to get in to public speaking to hopefully give others hope that there may be another side to this disorder (I recognize even with the bipolar 1 and 2 diagnosis, bipolar still affects everyone very differently).   My concerns with getting in to public speaking though is that I could hinder my future career goals, as this disorder still has a stigma, and I don’t want to be discriminated against in the work force. With that said, I could also see this helping my future career goals, as I think public speaking on a public health issue by sharing my personal experience, as well as the networking that comes with public speaking could be helpful.   So my question is, could trying to become a public speaker sharing my experience with bipolar 1 help or hinder my future career goals?",bipolar,bipolar,1792.0,0.0023469387755102006

1750221191,Very confused,"Hi all,   I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 with psychosis when I was 20. I’m 27 now and have been off my meds for about a year.. mainly because I don’t have insurance anymore and other personal reasons too. I don’t feel as bad as I used to honestly so my symptoms aren’t too intense from my POV.   For my mania, I used to have days where I wouldn’t sleep, have racing thoughts, horrible spending habits, psychosis was a big part too.. the whole shebang. For my depression, I wouldn’t get out of bed and I wouldn’t eat either so I would say it was pretty bad.   Fast forward to now, without taking medication, I still kind of have those symptoms but they’re more manic-based maybe? The depression isn’t really there anymore, at least not as bad as it used to be. I still have psychotic symptoms and they’re mainly visual with more detail than usual (I used to just see “shadows”). Whenever these happen, I don’t think I’m in an active manic episode so I’m not sure why they’re randomly occurring. I have felt more irritable lately (which I know is a symptom of mania) but I didn’t feel that when I was recently diagnosed all those years ago. I guess I’m confused about having this diagnosis since my symptoms have changed, and it makes me wonder if that’s even possible.

Now I’m at a point where I can’t really work because of my mental health, got extreme broke bc of this (in a lot of debt, owe family members a lot of money, can’t really afford my healthcare, stopped college bc I couldn’t pay the monthly fees and barely scraping by every month), never got over my ex who was really toxic so I can’t be happy with or without him, friends are all getting married or dating very seriously so I don’t have company to hang out anymore and since I don’t leave the house I can’t make new friends either. Also I don’t have cash to spend on nights out so there’s that too. I don’t work out anymore and feel so ashamed of my body bc it became weak and I can’t do the same things I used to or look how I used to look. People keep asking about me gaining so much weight and then losing it all so quickly and I don’t know what to say. I used to be beautiful, healthy, strong and now I’m a pale frail mess, looking extremely sickly, lots of vitamin deficiency and throwing up constantly.  I feel like my life is getting worse and worse over time and I’m tied up by this illness watching everything I ever hoped for slip away. Sometimes it seems like I’ll never be able to get rid of the debt since it just grows and grows each day and my income doesn’t, only way out would be education but I can’t study if I can’t afford it and with each day I feel more sunk in shit and that it gets more impossible to get out. I feel I will become more and more lonely too cause people’s lives are moving forward and they will eventually slip away if I can’t keep up, friends and romantic interests.  It just seems like my life has already gone to shit and there’s nothing I can do to fix it, like a game save file that you ruined and it’s best to just delete it and start a new one. That thought makes me wanna kill myself every fucking day because it doesn’t seem like I can turn this around. I’ve come too far in this mess to find my way back and it’s best to just give up trying and search for peace away from all of this.

1750130380,KEEP A JOURNAL!!,I really do think keeping a journal has been one of the best choices I have ever made. Not only has it helped me keep dates of when things happen but it also gives me a huge insight into who I am and how I act during different episodes. I've always struggled to remember how I felt during a manic episode or how I thought during a depressive episode and I've struggled to figure out the dates they have started or ended but now I can just look back and find when things changed. As someone who is still in the trial and error of different meds it has been really helpful in tracking my progress too!!!  Yes it can be super difficult at times to write in a journal and I find myself having large chunks of time missing from mine but if you can force yourself to sit and write anything it is helpful. I can write pages of rants or even just one sentence entries. There is no pressure at all and no one else will ever see it but you. Looking back on it I can SEE where I acted manic. It's like I can finally understand what other people have been telling me for so long. I even write about things that I barely have a recollection of doing or acting. The blank spots in my memory are finally filled! I remember everything that I need to bring up to my doctor! The veil of confusion and memory loss can be ripped away just by JOURNALLING.

I guess my doctor would be the right person to be asking.. but if anyone would like to give their 2 cents it would be extremely appreciated.

1750105430,Do empathetic psychiatrists exist?,"I have had the most difficult time finding a good psychiatrist. When I was initially discharged from my first psych ward stay, I had to wait two weeks before meeting with a virtual psychiatrist through LifeStance. The prescribed medications at the time were not a good mix to say the least (restless legs, still couldn't sleep, still extremely paranoid) but they just let me go, with no medical provider contact but my primary care physician. When I finally did see the virtual psychiatrist the psych ward connected me to, he clearly did not review my files, was very cold, and just said ""you've been given a second chance, don't screw this up."" at the end of our first session. How reassuring for someone freshly diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Two weeks passed, and I was still extremely manic and decided to go off my meds, leading to the second episode. After being discharged from a different facility, I still wasn't provided any resources with new psychiatric providers in the area, let alone the virtual psychiatrists I spoke to during my stay.

I've been calling practices in the area and virtual providers but everyone says they either don't treat patients in my age range, or can't help with bipolar disorder virtually, aren't accepting new patients, etc. I did book one appointment through Brightside, and answered all intake forms up front to let them know I had bipolar disorder. Provider gets on the call and says she can't treat bipolar disorder. But they made sure to take the $40 copay regardless. Also, in the short time I did speak with the psychiatrist through Brightside, I expressed that I was losing my hair and eating too much on my current prescriptions; she tells me you have to ""weigh the pros and cons"" of prescriptions. How reassuring. I've only tried two medication combinations at this point, and you're telling me to throw in the towel for one that doesn't even solve all of my mood regulation issues, and who cares about the hair loss anyways?

Lately I find myself wrestling with the fear that maybe I’m just hypomanic, that the days I’m not down aren’t real or sustainable. I know a lot of us face that same doubt when things start looking up. Just wanted to say you’re not alone in feeling this way and that it’s okay to embrace the progress you make, even if it feels uncertain.

1750078152,I feel like I’m an empty shell of who I once was,"24F. I’m really struggling. Throughout my life I have always been a high achiever with a low tolerance for any type of failure. I was very creative and I was always doing art, writing, and creative video games. I did great in high school and even the first couple of years of college were a breeze.  That was all until 2021 when I had my first major manic episode and then started rapid cycling. In that year I somehow went against all of my previous values, losing my virginity to a stranger and proceeding to sleep with any guy who wanted me, even friends. Then I discovered alcohol and things got even worse. I lost an entire group of friends, my grades tanked, and I plummeted into a 4 month long depressive episode. During that episode I finally got a real diagnosis of bipolar 1 after my worried parents insisted I see a psychologist. I was in denial for a while and refused any type of medication, until I had a failed attempt on my life and realized that I couldn’t keep going like this. The medicine worked wonders and I was finally stable, but in that time where I was so depressed and destructive, I feel like my creativity, attention span, and cognitive functioning were all severely damaged. It’s been 3 years since then and I’m still struggling to be the person I used to be. I’m slowly trying to introduce creative things into my life again but I just feel like an empty shell of who I used to be.

I have never spent excessive money, I have never felt… really *ANY* self-worth, or the need to talk fast. I feel like my “baseline” is depressed, and whenever I get relief from it, my parents believe that I’m manic.   My therapist says he has never seen me manic, I see him 2x/week.

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.  No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

1750797868,"It wasn’t cancer or anything scary, it was —- drumroll please—- SEASONAL ALLERGIES","My health anxiety has been THROUGH THE ROOF over the last month.  Started with some swollen lymph nodes in my neck, which freaked me out because I tragically lost my ESA to lymphoma last November, and just spiraled from there. So many random symptoms. Body aches, chest pain, chills with no fever etc etc. all scans and blood tests came back normal. Chest pain was getting worse. Shortness of breath.  Bruh.  I went to the doctor over the weekend because of some stuffiness in my ears, thinking maybe it was just a long lasting ear infection.   The doc: “hey so are you aware you’re severely congested rn”  Me: “what”  The doc: “yeah you don’t have an ear infection you’re like super congested everywhere (tm).”  Me: “so like a virus or a cold or somethin???”  The doc: “nah, bro, it looks like allergies.”  Me: *surprised pikachu face because I have NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD ANY ALLERGIES (neither has any of my immediate family) which I proceed to tell him*  The doc: “yeah I mean I see it a lot, we have rly high pollen counts here so people develop allergies that never had them before. I can prescribe u an antihistamine if u want”  Me: “I mean I’ll try it???? Okay yeah sure???”  Me: *proceeds to take a benedryl and it is like a night and day difference and suddenly I can BREATHE*    SO YEAH  SEASONAL. FREAKIN. ALLERGIES.

I knew that logically but with trauma from losing my baby I wasn’t able to make it feel true, despite my best efforts. It is quite funny though because at some point during this I made some health anxiety affirmations for myself:   “Your body is good at its job.”  “Your body’s job is to keep you alive.”  “Your body is not trying to kill you.”   Which, yk, is now not ENTIRELY true considering allergies are the body just attacking itself cuz it decides it don’t like something in ur environment, so, by that logic, the body was trying to kill me a little bit, and was, in fact, a little bad at its job.",Anxiety,anxiety,2124.0,0.029630952380952383

1750732370,I was robbed of my life. I hate that no one was ever concerned enough,"11 years ago, when I was 16, I developed a panic disorder. I started having repeated panic attacks, and obviously like many others, my first instinct was to go to the ER with my mom a few times.   Here's the thing, I live in a small town in Saudi Arabia. My mom is illiterate, and the doctor had told her that it was probably because I was watching porn. At the time, as a very direct result of my panic disorder, I was severely depressed. I was unable to move a muscle, and suicide ideation was, ironically, what kept me going. I could not bare to defend, or advocate for myself.  At that time, even though I was young, unwise, uneducated, and with so much prejudice against the taboo topic of psychiatric help, I knew what I had going on was not normal and needed medication.   After few weeks of being completely sedentary, my mom approached me one day to ask if I wanted to visit a psychiatrist. My face lit up, and I said yes without missing a beat, but then she said: noo, people will say that you're crazy!   I don't think any other single sentence was ever as traumatizing as this. Following this, I knew I was alone. I kept going with sheer will, and with the thought of offing myself always being in the back of my mind.   I slowly got better, or so I thought. I still got panic attacks occasionally over the years but with a decreasing frequency. And over the years, I've become a lot more independent and had my own discretion, but I started having health anxiety. I was scared off medications because of the damn hysteria and misinformation and because of my cultural background. The knowledge that I was able to get through the worst of it without being medicated didn't help either.   Little did I know, my undergraduate studies were interrupted a couple of times, and throughout the years I started repeatedly failing at different avenues of life. And funny enough, after being scared of seeking psychiatric help for so long, I later became an addict of every street drug there is. This got really bad at one point.   Nevertheless, after all those years, I acknowledged that I needed help. After becoming hooked on so many drugs I was no longer scared of psychiatric medications, so I decided fuck it and reached out to a doctor.   Now, six months later, I'm the biggest strong advocate of medications. I'm now the person I wish someone would have been for me. I'm not unapologetic about my recommendation. I'm not scared of liability or feelings of guilt; I strongly urge everyone who complains about their mental health to go see a psychiatrist.

1750776931,I Thought I’d Never Heal,"I’m 24, and to be honest, I’m still pretty raw. I’ve wrestled with OCD, anxiety rituals, and panic attacks that felt like they would never end. I’ve lost a lot along the way—parts of myself, relationships, stability. But I’m not drowning anymore. I’m starting to come back, slowly and unevenly, and weirdly enough, a few small things have helped me find my footing.  One of the first was something I call my “morning whisper.” When I wake up and manage to find even a sliver of quiet, I record a short voice note—just one line about how I’m feeling. Sometimes it’s “I’m scared of today,” other times it’s “I feel empty,” and once in a while it’s “I’m okay for now.” It doesn’t have to be poetic or profound. Just saying it out loud makes it feel less like a monster lurking in the corners of my mind.  Then there’s sunlight. Just five minutes of it. I step out onto my balcony, close my eyes, and let the sun hit my face. It’s such a small thing, but somehow it feels like a reset button for my nervous system. It reminds me that the world isn’t made entirely of shadows.  My therapist once suggested I try the Haven self-care app between sessions, and it’s become a lifeline. When anxiety spikes or I can’t sleep, I open the app and pour my thoughts into its little recorder. It listens and then gives me back a snapshot—a quick breakdown of my emotions. Seeing my thoughts reflected like that helps me make sense of what’s happening, especially when I’m not sitting across from her in that safe office space.  And maybe the strangest but most powerful ritual I’ve picked up is making private video confessions. I record myself talking to the camera—nothing polished, no audience. Just the raw truth. I say the things I’ve never said out loud before: “I’m scared I’ll never be okay,” “I miss who I used to be,” “I’m trying.” Somehow, giving those thoughts a voice, even if it’s only for me, makes them feel real and heard and maybe even a little less heavy.  I’m not “fixed.” Some days still suck. But these tiny rituals have given me something to hold onto—a sense that I’m moving forward, even if it’s one shaky, uncertain step at a time. If you’ve ever felt like you’re sinking, maybe try swapping one doom-scroll for one of these. You might be surprised at how much it helps. 💛",Anxiety,anxiety,2282.0,0.038076923076923085

1750785960,It gets better,"Hey everyone. Hello also people from Google.   A few years ago I was like a lot of folks who had never had a panic attack and never suffered from anxiety. Now I suffer from periodic attacks, and a baseline noticeable level of anxiety.   Long story short, I had my first panic attack a few years ago. I thought I was having a stroke or a heart attack and went to the ER. Obviously they told me it was just a panic attack, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t scary. It left me with PTSD - I never wanted to feel that ever again.   I quit smoking weed and nicotine. I couldn’t drink alcohol or coffee for months. Any sort of out of mind, or mind altering, made me panic.   I didn’t want to let it control me. I debated “sewer slide”. I thought about anything I could do to make it go away.   I’m very lucky in that I have a wife who suffers from anxiety as well, and a mom that suffers from depression. They all talked me through all of it. This made me not feel alone. They talked me into getting a therapist.   I’m here to tell anyone who needs to hear it that it gets better. It takes time but it does. I remember searching endlessly for proof tat it goes away. I feel like those who start to recover come to these communities less, but everyone could use some assurance.   The volume of anxiety goes down. I was a 15/10. Now I’m a 3-4/10. I can drink coffee and a beer. I can go on a plane. I can socialize. I can do all the things I used to.   Talk to someone. Get a therapist. It gets better.

1750785026,Idk what’s wrong with me,"The past few weeks or month or so I’ll go through these little spells of nausea and I used to never really get nauseous like that when I was experiencing anxiety but now more than ever when im anxious or even when I’m not particularly anxious in that moment I’ll get this slight feeling of nausea and then I’ll make myself more anxious about the nausea in hopes I don’t throw up especially if I’m in public which oddly makes me more nauseous it seems like. With that I’ll also get dizzy and it’s like I just have to sit there and hope it passes with deep breathing. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I’m more sensitive to heat now, which is new because I used to be able to tolerate the extreme heat but it never made me nauseous like it does now and the heat makes it all worse. Even when I’m not particularly in a hot area like in indoors I’ll get these like heat flashes. I’m just really confused about where this all stems from, and it’s a good chance it’s all from anxiety because I’ve been going through a lot of changes in my personal life and my anxiety’s been the highest it’s been in a long time. So that’s a good chance I’m just really considering going to the doctors and seeing if they can put me on anti nausea meds because it’s coming to the point of me not wanting to even go out of the house in fear I’ll get sick in public. I think I also trip myself out over it When I’m in public worried I’ll throw up because my mind will like worry itself out making me more sick. Yesterday I was in a really public setting and got slight nausea and then got these super weird intrusive thoughts about the people around me throwing up.

1750802025,How to get over fear of insects and pests? Especially of the unpredictability of it's actions/invading my comfort zone,"I have a huge phobia of insects, mice etc but especially when I didn't expect to see one/when they're in my safe zone. So when I see a spider out in the forest and it crawls on me? I see a mouse outside on the street? I don't care I go on it's fine.   But seeing a tick on my dog? Having insects fly into my house when I have open window? Randomly seeing a stink bug in my room? A praying mantis on my bike as I'm riding it? I FREAK OUT.   And usually it's not the insect itself. Yes there's insects I'm more scared of then others but usually it's the unpredictability of what's it going to do next. I know there's an insect but it disappears of my sight? I freak out because I don't know where it is and where it will appear again. I know the spider isn't venomous, I know the ladybug won't do anything to me but the sound of it flying around in my room is enough to give me goosebumps.   I saw a stag beetle out in the open last week and even took a video of it because it was beautiful. But this? I will stay awake and it occupies my head for a long time.

1750782423,Help my Nan deal with her feelings,"Hi All,   So my Nan is 90 years old, she is constantly in fear/scared about death and I'm looking for a way to help her be atleast a bit more at ease.   Last year she had pneumonia and recovered just fine after a few months albeit with trouble breathing compared to before (which is expected at that age). She was generally happy about the situation and the fact that she was going back to as she was before. However, 1 month ago she had a chest infection and has anti biotics to help this, so hopefully that clears up soon as the doctor says.   Every single day, she sits at home/at ours with nothing to do really. So she ends up focusing on the fact that her breathing isn't great, which makes her breathing hard, throat tight etc. Which then causes her to think worse about the situation. Not only that, when it gets to 7pm she is already trying to calm herself down as she hates evening/night time as she can't sleep and ends up focusing on her issues again/ causing herself to choke or get a heart attack. It's a self fulfilling prophecy really.   So while I'm not asking for a way to fix her physical issues, realistically they won't heal to 100%. However, I'm after methods/techniques that she can employ to help her get used to her feelings and not dwell on them.   Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",Anxiety,anxiety,1317.0,0.08724747474747474
1750800305,Given buspirone as a take as needed anxiety relief Med,"So after years of being depressed and my anxiety becoming unbearable where I'm missing work and falling behind on things, I finally caved and went to see someone about medication. My panic attacks have gotten so bad I'll pace the house for hours and will have to leave work early because of them. I had anxiety issues years ago without the depression and was on 1mg lorazepam 2 or 3x times a day(can't remember since it was so long ago) and I barely filled it and never abused it. Hell I never even took more than one a day and had this prescription for years. I'm talking about a prescription of 90 of them and I filled it like once every year and a half. I only stopped filling it because I got to a point in my life where I didn't feel I needed it.   So I went in expecting to get an antidepressant(prozac), which I honestly wanted to try. No big deal. So then I'm given basically the option of a drowsy medicine(hydroxyzine), which I can't take since I run machines, and I'm given a non drowsy one(buspirone) as a take as needed. Obviously I take the non drowsy option but kind of upset lorazepam wasn't offered because even they made the comment that in my records it says I barely filled it but still gave me the whole habit forming and better alternative now spiel. But whatever, I accept the buspirone. Bottle says 5mg 2x as needed.   So I get home and research both medications as I always do before putting something in my system to find out this buspirone is supposed to be used more like antidepressants and slowly builds up in your system. Is that right? If so, how do I approach them and tell them this is wrong. You also might have guessed this was a nurse practitioner as well. I was having a hard time finding places that accepted new patients(haven't been to a doctor in years), and this was kind of my last option.

Last year I took a 2 hour train journey to a town for a day trip, totally happy and content and about half way through I got this intense feeling of panic, I felt like I had to get off the train (I did) and I was hot (took off my jacket and shirt on the train) and it was really fkn scary as I had never had that sensation before and ever since then I’ve had a real fear of trains. I go up to London every now and then and each time I’ve gone (maybe 4-5 times) I’ve had a small spurt of panic on the way there and it lasts about 2 minutes then I’m okay so not to bad. Today I went to London (I drove) but had to get on a train for about 4 minutes. I absolutely freaked, my boyfriend had to almost push me back down into my seat, about 5 minutes into the journey I was okay. We got off and I thought I’d be fine as I’d never had this panic feeling in open environments (I’ve come to the conclusion it was closed spaces I knew I couldn’t get out of) but today I experienced it all fucking day on and off😢 We had to get a 30£ Uber back to the area we were in and cancel our dinner reservations as the idea of getting on the underground made me feel sick just thinking about it. When we got to our place I was okay ish and wasn’t really thinking about it, we decided to go to dinner at a place close to us and I was fine. Right before our meal came out the panic started again? So intensely too! I was absolutely freaked and I felt hot, nauseas and just like I had to get out of there. Absolute fight or flight like what I had felt in the other times during the day. We had to get our meal to takeaway. I was crying at the table not knowing what to do. What is this?!

I spent the few first years of my life in a fairly dangerous town. You couldn’t go a week or sometimes days without hearing that somebody had gotten shot, murdered, or rap*d. I was exposed to the world’s harsh realities at a very young age, and had to deal with my own families cruelty.

The older I got, the more I was exposed to just how horrible people are.  Humans are capable of so much, and it’s terrifying. The news was just a harbor for all of its negativity and sorrow. School shootings, somebody being murdered or sexually assaulted, animal abuse, country genocide, wrongful deportations, the law, people who are supposed to protect us, failing us over and over again, siding with the people who are doing the hurting.

I’m completely terrified of other peoples’ opinions and terrified of being deemed a “bad” person by the standards of others. I attach my sense of self worth to the approval and validation of others. I feel like if I’m disliked in any way, then my life has zero value. If people don’t like me, then what is the point of existing? Because of this, I’m in a constant state of feeling like everyone hates me and that I don’t deserve to exist. I can’t even enjoy life. I feel like going outside in the sun and laughing is an insult to someone out there who is morally superior to me. These behaviors mostly into doomscrolling and validation seeking.   Here is a lighthearted example before I get into the serious stuff: Let’s say there is a band I like. But a popular music critic and/or a friend doesnt like them. As a matter of fact they hate them. This critic gave the band a 1/10 and also called their fans idiots. My friend said the same thing. At this point, I’ll delete all their albums from Spotify, shove my shirts to the back of my closet, and never listen to them again. If I hear one of their songs in the radio, or see someone wearing their shirt in public, I’ll go into this dissociative state where I just repeat the critic or friends words in my head over and over and over again. I can’t ever enjoy the music again, because I don’t want to be an idiot like the critic said, I don’t want my friend to think I have bad taste. This is just how I act with something as silly as a music opinion.   At the current moment, I feel guilty for being American. I feel like the whole world hates me.

So I have been diagnosed with a disease called Crohns Disease since december of last year, and the disease has not really given me any really bad symptoms.

I am currently a pilot student and so far the disease has not really gotten in the way of my medical licence, but now I have been switched from a private GI to a GI connected to a hospital, and they are talking about starting me on a maintenance drug, they are talking about either Azathioprine or Adalimumab, but the panic attacks started before this, but has gotten worse / more frequent since this. It has gotten to a point where I struggle to leave the house because I fear that I might get a panic attack, and they primarily happen when I am not at home. I am curious to see if anyone else has expeirenced this or something similar? or if people have any advice besides seeing a therapist? My current plan is to wait until I actually start a maintenance drug, and to see if it calms down after that, and if not, I will visit a therapist.

It’s always been present but lately it has been significantly worse, basically worrying about a new thing every week, sometimes twice a week.   The latest thing that’s happened has been a pretty constant feeling like I need to go pee, and more frequently going, it could be every 1-2 hours, but sometimes it’s only 20-30 minutes later that I’ll get a creeping sensation of it coming  Naturally I’m thinking about it a lot. Some basic bloodwork and urine sample has apparently come back normal. Naturally I’m worried why it’s still persisting now and if there is further physical investigation needed etc.  I’ve also found in the last few days I’ve had some middle back tightness   this peeing thing has happened a handful of times over the last 9 months or so, and then it’s blown over a day or 2 later. And I haven’t thought about it as much. This time it’s been ongoing for about a week. I feel like im spiralling, but the urge to pee really is there.  I know this subject has been discussed before on here, but I’m looking for some updated thoughts or shared experiences if anyone can relate or has been through this. I’m freaked out about something that has yet to be discovered, and now if there’s any connection to the back tightness/pain.   Any insight is really appreciated, especially on health anxiety and this peeing relationship. It feels too coincidental to me to not be anxiety, but I don’t know.

About 12 years ago, I started experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety, such as dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, tunnel vision, tachycardia, chest palpitations, etc. A doctor prescribed me escitalopram, and after a few weeks, everything improved. During all those years, i was great, I tried other medications such as duloxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, fluvoxamine, etc. They all worked very well for me with no side effects except sexually, thats why I tried several options just to find the one that wouldn't cause them. I found that fluvoxamine worked perfectly.     The problem is that last year I tried to stop taking medications because i wanted to see if I no longer needed them. So I slowly tapered off the medicine. For about a month I was doing very well, but then the anxiety symptoms returned, dizziness, vertigo, rapid heart rate, and now depression too. So a psychiatrist prescribed me fluvoxamine again. This time it improved the vertigo and dizziness but caused a lot of fatigue and worsened other symptoms like rapid heart rate and confusion. We tried several options, such as escitalopram again, then desvenlafaxine, and with all of them some symptoms seem to improve and worsen others. The thing is that SSRIS (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or SNRIS (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) didn't cause any major problems before even when i used them for the first time years ago. I'm currently taking bupropion 150mg and gabapentin 300mg, and I'm better especially of the depression, but not completely about the anxiety, I still have some symptoms that aren't improving like light sensitivity, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, rapid heart rate, etc.     I think my anxiety hasn't completely gone away because the lack of the serotonin focus of the medication, since I understand bupropion acts on norepinephrine and dopamine, and in the past SSRIS and SNRIS took away the anxiety easy.     But if that's the case, why are SSRIS and SNRIS medications causing me side effects or worsening some symptoms if they didn't do it before?     Has anyone experienced something similar?     Of course, I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but I would like to hear some opinions since my symptoms haven't completely gone away with bupropion after like three months.     Should I ask my doctor to try again with a SSRI or SNRI and wait for the side effects to pass even though that kind of meds weren't causing me any major problems before?     P.S. In case it's important, I exercise a lot, eat well, and have always had very good results in medical tests.     Thank you very much for your help and time.",Anxiety,anxiety,2710.0,0.17837719298245613

I didn’t think much of it at first but it’s starting to get very annoying. I asked a client for advil the other day and nearly gagged it up all on their floor. I’ll be eating dinner with family, feeling fine, then my body just.. wants to gag. So embarrassing. Does anyone else have/ had experiences like this..? Were you able to figure out what was causing it?  The only other thing I can think of is I think my sense of smell is finally coming back after the whole covid thing.. other than that my diet, habits, everything else is the same.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks",Anxiety,anxiety,1161.0,0.09128401360544218
1750788354,I'm so over health anxiety,Hi I want to say that I am new here and feeling really overwhelmed right now. So here's my story. I've been sick with a cold / virus and my lymphnodes are swollen in my neck and armpit for 9 days now. Like at home feeling like garage. It's not Covid. My logic tells me that it takes time to feel better sometimes. But the health anxiety says... Oh my gosh what if it pneumonia or your septic or you have cancer. Then I'm crying and a complete wreck! Why can't I just be normal and have a cold instead of it being a catastrophe! I'm just so over this nutty thinking! Thank you,Anxiety,anxiety,575.0,-0.10547077922077923

1750765178,A rant about anxiety,"Hello everyone. This is a rant about anxiety and a little bit of a cry for help too. I will quickly go over my issues, so you will understand my point of view and where I am exactly right now.   I have been dealing with anxiety since my teenage years, which will be around 15 years now. I am used to it, I have been managing it for years, it is probably some general anxiety disorder, which manifested in temporary obsessions with different kind of problems. It came in waves and it went away, daily, weekly, monthly ...   But for the past two years it has been different. I have developed restroom anxiety, no idea what it triggered it. Probably a combination of stress, my body sensation obsessions and a few other stuff. I have compulsions (going to bathroom even if I don't have to) and it is really tiring. This freaking thing does not go away and I don't know what exactly I am doing or not doing.     I have my own therapist, we discussed the issue, I know thee root problem (shame), I know that I just have to accept it, but I just can't get past it. Like I would logically understand what I have to do, but I just can't. I am stuck in a loop. It get a little better, and then it gets worse and it goes in a circle.   I was prescribed antidepressants, but I don't take them since I am terrified of side effects. I would rather live with this (I still somehow think that it is better to live this way that to regret fucking my life up even more). And I know that it could potentially be good for me, but I really can't. At this point I am really lost.   The worst part is that no one understands. When I want to share something, I just feel more dumb, like how can I have this tiny problem I am obsessing with it when people have real problems.   I still have one thing to try, meditation. I am really bad at sticking with new habits, so that's why I still have not tried it. I know I have to go through it, to learn to live with it and to just observe. But it is so damn hard.  Before you say anything, I am exercising, I have a good life, a good partner, a nice job, a lot of hobbies. I think that is why it is even harder. I can't enjoy things I have and it is eating me alive.   I don't even know what is the point of this rant. Maybe just wanted to let something out, maybe I just want to hear your experiences.

1750785090,Constant suffocation by anxiety,"I feel defeated a lot of the time.    I grew up in an abusive household, and have had severe anxiety for as long as I can remember. I missed a third of my junior year of HS, a bunch of my sophomore and senior years to severe anxiety/autism meltdowns (still graduated with honors, but still.)   My life remains helplessly controlled and dictated by my anxiety. It's gotten better (I don't have a meltdown going into a crowded place all the time anymore).   Currently one of the only solutions for my anxiety is drugging myself with weed (I live in California.) But I obviously can't be high all the time, I need to function to some degree.  I've TRIED the somatic exercises, I've tried the deep breathing, but deep breathing makes my head spin (I also have POTS, that probably isn't helping), and I'm at a loss of what to do or where to go.   I've been on meds for it for nearly a decade (I'm 23M.)   I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, DID, OCD, ASD, ADHD, and severe generalized anxiety disorder.

1750784797,"Constant fatigue, mental overload, and disconnection from myself – does anyone else feel this way?","Hi everyone, This is my first time posting here. I’m writing because I’m trying to understand what’s happening to me, and maybe connect with others who feel the same.  I’m 29 and, from the outside, I live a “healthy” life: I sleep 7.5 hours a night, I barely drink (2–3 drinks max, once a month), and I try to take care of myself. Yet I wake up every morning completely exhausted, as if I hadn’t slept at all. It’s not just physical – it’s like a constant mental fog that never lifts.  I’ve explored some medical causes. I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea, but not severe enough to need treatment. I also have dust mite allergies and started desensitization. My sleep is extremely light, and it’s become a point of tension in my relationship: the slightest sound wakes me, especially in the early part of the night, and when that happens, I can’t fall back asleep. Strangely, if I wake up later in the night, I fall asleep again easily.  At work, I’m seen as sharp, efficient, fast. But in my head, it’s constant chaos. When I get home, my brain keeps spinning. I jump between small tasks, unable to focus, like I’m afraid of forgetting something. I start unpacking my bag, realize I need to do laundry, go to the kitchen to get detergent, forget why I’m there, unload the dishwasher instead, remember the laundry again… and so on. It’s like my working memory is constantly overwhelmed, and I can’t stay present on one task.  To make things worse, I feel this almost compulsive need to get everything done the moment I get home, as fast as possible, in a weird state of tension – as if I could finally relax once it’s all done. But that moment of rest never truly comes. It feels almost pathological – like I’m running toward peace that always stays out of reach.  And even when I do sit down, I can’t mentally unwind. I start scrolling, searching random stuff online, watching videos… anything to avoid sitting in silence. I feel like I’ve lost access to calmness, or that I’m running from myself.  I also feel completely disconnected from who I am. I have a hard time setting boundaries or making choices. I just follow the flow of work, chores, fatigue… but if someone asked me “what would bring you joy?” or “what do you want to do this weekend?”, I honestly wouldn’t know. It’s like I’ve lost my ability to want.  Something else that weighs heavily on me: I often hold myself back from enjoying time with friends. I’d love to let go, stay up late, drink more, just be in the moment – but I know the aftermath is brutal. Just one night of excess hits me with days of fatigue and a sharp drop in mood. So I stay “reasonable,” go home early, keep things under control – and as a result, I end up feeling frustrated, out of sync, and often left out.  Social situations also drain me more and more. I’m okay when there’s a goal or structure (like a game), but small talk exhausts me. Talking about myself makes me anxious, being the center of attention too. People often tell me to “just relax” or “let go,” but honestly, I no longer know how. It’s not a mindset – it feels like I’ve lost the ability to access that state.  So I’m wondering: Does anyone else experience something similar? Could this be ADHD, burnout, hypersensitivity, or something else entirely? Have you found anything that helped you reconnect with yourself, find peace, or even just breathe again?

I should stop doing it, but I have a hard time not rebutting them when they say something stupid.    I don't think it's the only cause of my anxiety. I feel restless, I pay too much attention to my stomach, I stared at this text I wrote for a while, looking from one side to the other, my actions didn't make much sense.    Is my heart heavy?

I'm overwhelmed by something and I don't know what, I hate this feeling so much, has it always been there? Is it new or am I barely aware of it? I don't know, many times I have considered going to a psychiatrist to see if he will prescribe me something, but leaving aside that it is very expensive for me to afford (the psychiatrist, not the medication) I feel that it is a little excessive because this does not prevent me from living, it does not prevent me from being a person, if they talk to me I pay attention, if I have something to do I do it, but I don't like being busy all the time, but when I have free time I start to think and wander, I try to play to distract myself, but well, halfway there it works, I could read, but I procrastinate reading a lot.",Anxiety,anxiety,1738.0,-0.057630471380471365

1750783207,Hypothetical Scenario,Imagine you were the reason people around the world were feeling “anxious” and “depressed”. Real depression and anxiety does exist and it isn’t because of you but because of you people feel sensations and feelings that are the same as anxiety and depression. What would you do? You don’t want to cause people to feel that way but you do. You can’t explain to people that you’re the reason why they’re feeling that way because they would think you’re crazy and won’t believe you. Or if they do believe you they would hate you for it. You hate that you are “controlling” people’s emotions. If you feel anxious other people feel more anxious so you try to avoid anything that would make you anxious and stay in bed numbing your emotions and stop thinking. You want to continue with your life just as other people get to but when you try to people start complaining that they feel anxious and depressed and life sucks again. You try not to think about the effect you’re having on people because if you think too much you get scared about how many people you are affecting negatively. Some days you’re able to give people a “good day” by not thinking too much and staying distracted but then you start to get anxious or think too much and then everyone has a “bad day” and complains that they were doing so good but got “back to square one” or want to “delete themselves”. You start to feel bad that no matter how many good days you give the moment you give a bad day all that work becomes meaningless. You think maybe you should stop trying to focus at all on how you’re affecting people and just do what you want and not care if you’re causing people to have “bad days” because you should prioritize yourself. But once you in a while you decide to check what people are saying on forums. You start to feel a bit mad at everyone because you know they don’t actually have “anxiety” or “depression” but you are making them feel ways in which makes them think they do. You feel mad because they are so anxious/depressed and you wish they would stop feeling that way. You feel mad because you know everyone in the world is feeling the way they are but they are able to get along fine with life but these people can’t/won’t.,Anxiety,anxiety,2215.0,-0.10563063063063062

I’ve had anxiety most my life and the first panic attack I ever had was in 5th grade and I stayed panicked for the rest of the school year. My mom put me in therapy and that’s eventually what helped.   At 20 years old I had another serious lapse in mental health and was inconsolable for weeks/months. I got on meds and again all was okay.   Then it was my first job out of law school where I had yet another mental break where I got on meds and felt fine.   My mom passed in May 2023, I coped with it by smoking weed and pretending I’m fine and I never got help for it.

Now 3 years later I’m at possibly the worst I’ve ever felt. I have this panic and anxiety that there’s just no self soothing for. I can’t do anything to escape this feeling. I live alone, work an incredibly stressful job with stressful deadlines and the weight of billable hours on me all the time. When I’m anxious I have this constant tight chest that makes me feel like I can’t breathe sometimes and there’s nothing I can do when it happens to get it to stop except try to do breathing exercises.

I’m here because I feel lost and alone, and a little embarrassed. I’m now 25yo, and I’ve dealt with some anxiety my whole life, but it’s always been manageable. I might need a day here or there to recuperate, but I’ve always been able to rationalize and get back on track.  This last year I’ve dealt with some normal life changes - I moved out, my job has become more stressful after my boss left, and experienced some depression due to some friendship stuff. I could feel myself slowly becoming more and more anxious this year, but I didn’t really want to deal with it. After coming back from a week-long vacation, I went back to work and had my first panic attack. I’d never experience anything like it, and it terrified me. I have an understanding employer, I explained everything and he wants to work with me, and I’m very grateful for that. I do feel stressed at my job, and partially it’s because I’ve taken on responsibilities that no one else knows anything about. But, I’ve explained that to my boss, and I’ve been trying to rationalize with myself that it’s ok that I don’t know every next step. But I tend to get panicky now when met with something I’m unfamiliar with.   But since the panic attack, it’s like every stressful thing puts me in fight or flight mode. I have been to the dr (finally bit the bullet) and I started on Lexapro. I’m also seeing a therapist today (virtually). Since starting the medication last week, I took off work for 3 days because I couldn’t handle the idea of leaving home and dealing - I was in shambles, crying, unable to breathe properly, my throat felt tight.  Having to request time off to deal with this made me feel guilty. And embarrassed. I live a good life, I have a wonderful family and friends, all who are extremely supportive.   I just want to hear from others that may be experiencing the same thing. What helped you get back on track? How did you deal with guilt?  Is there anything you can recommend for morning anxiety - I tend to wake up with racing thoughts and that tight feeling in my throat.   Wishing everyone well, and super appreciate of anything you can share!",Anxiety,anxiety,2241.0,0.13558931148216866
1750760164,My anxiety just potentially ruined my friendship for being too overbearing/obsessive...How to best move forward?,"I [33M] have a friend [32F] who I’ve known for 15+ years. We live long distance and established connection again a couple of years ago. In that time, we’ve texted almost every day, had phone calls about 2x per week, and I even went to visit her last winter so she could show me around her town.  While there was no sign that anything would escalate into a serious relationship, I was creating situations in my head that made me believe it could be possible. I have strong feelings for this person, but I know she won’t reciprocate. I’ve never told her what I really think of our friendship.  Lately, especially over the last several months, I became more and more obsessive. I would send multiple messages over the course of a couple of days without a response, then have racing thoughts about why she isn’t replying. I’d check to see if she added any followers on Instagram and would want to know why she’s doing that instead of replying to me. Most of my free time was being spent wondering what else she could be doing.  I recently went through a layoff at work and started a new job a few weeks ago. The anxiety from this has made my behavior more severe. As I’ve been navigating these life changes I became even more fixated on getting her validation and attention. I couldn’t go more than a few minutes without checking my phone to see if she’s reached out. My sleep and appetite suffered. I was suddenly very distracted and scatter-brained with other people in my life because I was treating her as the only one whose opinion mattered.  This culminated in a rather unhealthy way recently. I noticed my conversations were becoming more one-sided. One day she mentioned she was hanging out with a guy she just met. Casual things like going to the beach, watching the sunset. My mind immediately went into overdrive and I felt an instant sense of jealousy and vulnerability. I wanted to know who this person was and whether this was going to be serious. As she was becoming less responsive to my messages, or at least just more brief than before, I felt her sort of slipping away and I didn’t know how to handle it.  I can’t fully explain why, but something told me to look her up on the dating apps to see how she’s presenting herself. I took my Hinge profile and set it to her town. I spent several minutes swiping to try to find her, and eventually I did. Nothing surprising or crazy. I left my location as hers, and I’m almost certain she found me on the app as she was swiping and got surprised/freaked out.  My messages since then have gone completely unanswered, calls go right to voicemail. I’m not blocked on social media but am likely muted or restricted. I sent her an apology on facebook about how needy I’ve been recently (without explicitly mentioning this latest example) and it hasn’t been read yet. I feel terrible for letting this get to the point where I’ve potentially lost a friend. My social circle isn’t that large to begin with, so this intensifies those feelings of rejection and abandonment. Unfortunately, I also think if I kept obsessing in this way for much longer, it was likely bound to culminate in something like this. I haven’t been approaching any of this in a healthy way.  This has opened my eyes to how my anxiety can seize me with an iron grip. I’ve never had it treated but I’m ready to do that now by looking into therapy. It's something I've only considered one other time when a family member passed away, but I never followed through. Now I really do believe I need a professional opinion to help explore why I feel these things and how to properly process them.  I’ve also realized I'll need to gradually build up my social circle to have more quality, supportive friendships. I’m considering volunteering at local organizations and being more proactive with reaching out to people I haven’t heard from in a while to see if they’d like to catch up.  Being blocked/muted can actually free myself now to not worry about seeking that little “rush” when I get a message or call from her. On the one hand I’m truly disappointed in myself, but on the other it could be just what I need to allow me to focus and learn about what I have to do to get in a better headspace. I’d appreciate anyone’s thoughts on how to best move forward or if you have any similar experiences to draw from. I’ve been sitting with these thoughts all night and need to get them out there.

1750773425,Blood in stool caused by anxiety?,"Hi there, im writing here because im totally lost to be honest.  To start off, I'm an 18 year old male with no family history of cancer To simplify it a lot, I've had some kind illness that caused me to have very bad diarrhea. After a week or so after i ate spicy food and i saw a very very small spot of something red in my stool. Being the hypochondriac i am i went to the doctor and had all sorts of tests done. I had stool, blood and urine tests, and a Digital rectal examination. During this time i was incredibly anxious, barely being able to get out of bed let alone do anything productive. I barely even ate. I had multiple panic attacks and i was over all in a horrible mood. All the tests came back negative. By the time i was done i hadn't had blood for 2 months, and my doctor said they can't really send me to anymore tests since there's no reason to, so i was sorta convinced I'm fine. Well, later that week i went to kfc with my friends and i had way more blood than ever before, or after since. I tried to brush it off, saying maybe i just got a fissure from the rectal examination, but after that, almost every week, almost precisely a week later, i had blood. I began dieting and using hemorrhoids cream, my reasoning being that a rectal exam would miss an internal hemorrhoid, so i must have had that. I was still incredibly anxous, fearing the worst (cancer [yes i know it's stupid im 18 and have no other symptoms]) i had a calprotectin test that came back negative as well, so i went and had another rectal exam, which found nothing, then i had a rectoscopy. Neither of them found anything.  Now here's the part I'm confused about: My doctor said that due to my age and lack of symptoms, it's probably a stress related. He insisted that stress can cause blood in stool, but I've never heard of anything like that, even though i was researching the topic a ton since i was incredibly anxious about it. I know I'm not a doctor, thats why i want to ask if anyone here has ever experienced something like this? Pure stress causing blood in stool.  I find it odd, because even though i never heard of anything like this, his advice seemed to work. I just tried stressing about it less and it seemed to work. I've gone 3 whole weeks without having any blood! Unfortunately last night i had a pretty bad wave of anxiety due to unrelated personal stuff that lasted for a couple of hours, and lo and behold, today i woke up and had a bloody stool. Can it really be stress related? Everything points to this being the case but wherever i search online they say stress alone can't cause blood. The only thing similar is that ibs maybe sometimes can cause blood, but i don't really have cramping or anything, maybe gas or frequent stools when im stressed but nothing severe...  I feel totally lost right now...the doctor said to just relax and continue life as normal, but to go back if there is still blood and that he'll do a colonoscopy  Now im not really sure what to do...should i go back because there was blood or not because it really could just be stress like he said.  So please, if anyone had anything similar please tell me, just so that i can know that it's not bullshit or something. I want to trust my doctor and i realize he knows way more than i do but doubt just keeps crawling back into my mind  TL;DR: Has anyone has blood in stool that was caused purely by intense stress?

1750727177,Help Me Get Out of this Plastic Anxiety - Please!!,"I had my anxiety triggered over this past weekend. I drank a sip of water from reusable plastic water bottle that was left under direct sun light for about 3 hours.

It just hit me then that I was not supposed to leave it there. Now, I'm so worried about chemicals (estrogenic chemicals or endocrine disruptors, whatever they call it) leaching from the plastic and entered my body. It was just a sip. It was warm. When I read more about plastic issue, I'd just realized that I should not even use plastic water bottle, not even reusable ones. I've been using reusable plastic water bottle, made of Tritan plastic, for more than a year. I used stainless steel one before, but decided to try plastic somehow since it is lightweight. Bad decision, I know!  It reminds me that in the past, I also microwaved those frozen food black tray containers.

1750771062,I feel like my medication stopped working for me?,"Not sure if anyone will even see this post as most of my stuff never gets replied to anywhere, but I'll just vent I guess...  I feel like I am slowly going crazy. My diagnosis is GAD and severe health anxiety along with a few panic attacks here and there. For most of the time I was fine, I was on 10mg of Citalopram for about 4-5ish years. I did feel quite fine back then, yes there were ocassional panic attacks here and there but I never had to turn to my SOS medication (bromazepam).   This year however I hit a rough patch when having a health scare which sent me spiraling and had to leave work for month and a half, I came back and felt a bit better but I feel like the higher dosage of Citalopram (currently 20mg) did really nothing for me, if anything I loose control quite easier. I can't seem to stop thinking about my body constantly failing me whenever I have the slightest pain in my body or the tiniest headache. I always think that it's my blood pressure spiking and that I'll get a stroke/heart attack and die. I feel so extremely aware of everything it's literally destroying my life.      I eat some food that had been sitting out for a little bit, I freak out cause I'm definitely having food poisoning. I get the slightest headache, I freak out cause I think I'm having a stroke. My face gets sunburnt, I get convinced it's not a sunburn and my face is flushed like that because of extremely high blood pressure and I might die any minute. These things always send me into overdrive, my heart starts to run a marathon and I feel faint. It's honestly so shit.   I know that pills won't magically fix everything, it's all about the mind and how we deal with these situations I do realise everything, but I feel like ever since I spiraled back into the toxic mindset I can't get out and my medication just isn't working anymore as it used to, should I contant my psychiatrist and try him to get me on something different? I'm scared I'll have to leave work if things continue at this rate. I work as a caretaker in a nursing home and I can't afford having low mental health.

1750769756,"First time seizure-like symptoms, unsure if its anxiety and/or sleep apnea","Hello, everyone. I'd only like to ask if this is likely anxiety, panic attacks, or sleep apnea. Because of how similar the symptoms are from panic attacks to seizures or something, I'm not quite sure and I haven't gone to the doctors to get assessed since we're lacking finance to consider and I haven't told this to my parents about this.  Yesterday, I slept around 7-8pm, woke up at 10pm, slept again and I woke up around 1am(?), then the moment I was conscious, I involuntarily took a big deep breath before proceeding to uncontrollably shaking or twitching? I was aware of what's happening, but I couldn't control anything at all, my eyes are closed but I can't open them. It only lasted a few seconds, afterwards it's as if nothing happens, but I was really terrified and confused of what had happened, it's also the first time that had happened to me. I was laying down on a soft-ish-hard surface with a pillow. I fell asleep after calming down and since then, I haven't experienced anything like that anymore. I planned on telling this to my parents, but in terms of health-related, they discard it most of the time, so I haven't bothered telling them yet.  For context though, the reason why it could be anxiety, is because I've been stressed so much in recent weeks, so much work had to be done, lack of sleep, and adding my health anxiety for searching so much of whatever symptoms and diseases I'm having, and it's still ongoing. As for sleep apnea, I do notice I take deep breaths in some points when I do sleep because I felt like I forgot to breathe.",Anxiety,anxiety,1564.0,0.08078703703703703
1750768991,Health anxiety anxiety,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety for the past three years, ever since the death of my best friend,.It started with chest pain, and I thought it was a heart attack. I did over 20 ECGs, troponin tests, and everything else—but my heart was fine. Then I thought it might be kidney failure, so I got ultrasounds and X-rays, but my kidneys were in perfect shape. After that, I started worrying about my liver, but all the LFTs came back normal. I even had pain in my spleen, but another ultrasound showed it was fine. I’ve had multiple chest scans and countless blood tests—everything has been normal.  Still, I started having panic attacks. My anxiety has never gone away in these past three years, and no one really seems to understand what I’m going through. My family moved to another country for a better future, but since we arrived, my mind has been racing for the past six months. I keep thinking I have leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer—every possible cancer. But my blood tests aren’t just okay—they’re very good. Yet, I’m exhausted. I live with 24/7 shortness of breath, chest pain that comes and goes, hot flashes, body aches. I feel like I don’t want to live anymore. I haven’t felt truly happy in three years. I spend most days lying in bed. When I go out, everything seems blurred. I feel confused and lightheaded.   My father is very supportive—he loves me deeply and has always given me everything I wanted, even when his income was limited. No matter what I asked for, he made sure I had the best. I know how much he has sacrificed for me. Now, it’s my time to take responsibility. He’s getting older, and I need to take care of my siblings and our family. All I want is to give my father some happiness—that’s all that matters to me.    I’m the eldest son in my family, so I have a lot of responsibilities, but I feel like I can’t do anything.

I used to smoke weed alot back in 2022 to help, to which I had to stop due to chest palpitations that I start getting from it. Now these chest palpitations felt very scary, flutters that just never went away for multiple days. I went to the emergency room when It got really bad to which after a few test, they chalked it up as anxiety induced. I told them it only happened because of my smoking so they told me to just simply stop. They said the weed couldve made the anxiety that I already had worse so cutting back might be the best solution.   Months go past and these chest palpitations DONT go away. My parents tell me to “stay calm and breathe” like im not already doing that. I dont even be anxious half of the time but they never go away. I also get CRAZY chest pain and other weird bodily symptoms. Obviously all of this can make anyone think somethings is seriously wrong. In 2023 I go to a cardiologist to which they put me on a heart monitor. After wearing it for a few months they also said that everything was perfectly fine.   At this point I really just told myself to trust the doctors and just wait for the chest palpitations to pass. Trust the doctors that your CRAZY chest pain is just anxiety. Trust that the doctors did they due diligence in making sure your fine.  As the years go pass more different bodily feelings arise. A new thing I deal with are chest vibrations near where my heart is which is also very scary. All of these things play a huge part in why my anxiety has gotten worse of the years. I feel physical symptoms and my brain doesn’t agree that its just anxiety. I always think to myself “What if the doctors are wrong and one day im just gonna have a huge heart attack or something” …I always think to myself I must have some weird rare heart disorder or something because why does this happen to me? I bring myself to reddit because I see alot of people deal with similar issues that I do, which gives me more comfort than what the doctor says which is backwards but thats just the way it is.

A whole charade went down, but eventually after dealing with this for ~20 minutes i called 911 in fear of this possibly being the start of something serious, but they checked my vitals and told me i was all good.   The thing that really made this bad though was that it was literally out of nowhere, and ive never ever had this happen before. I was in a great mood and then it went downhill. So im left wondering, is this a thing that happens? Did i subconsciously associate smelling something burnt toast adjacent to having a stroke and that triggered something to have a panic attack? This was 3 days ago, and im still having breathing problems. I dont know im really just trying to figure out what happened. Please feel free to ask any questions, any help is greatly appreciated.",Anxiety,anxiety,1059.0,0.10381944444444445

1750759939,TW: First ever panic attack(s?),"I 23M just had my first full blown panic attack(s?). It lasted about 20 minutes total, with a brief pause about halfway through. I’ve been in a deep depression for about 4 months now. I was crying myself to sleep when it happened and by the time I noticed I was having one, it was in full swing. Shallow uneven breaths, shaking, the inability to move, mixed in with my occasional sobs and a vice grip like feeling clamping down on my chest. At one point I was frozen, literally unable to move my body while shaking, legs locked out straight with my arms close to my chest as I lay in bed looking at the ceiling. When the brief pause occurred, I got up to walk around my room to try and snap out of it. That’s when it kicked in again. I couldn’t move as I felt my breathing quicken and my chest tighten. I don’t know how I was able to but I crawled back into my bed. It was like I was moving through wet cement, literally fighting my body to get back into bed. I just curled up and tried to ride it out as best as I could. When it finally ended I felt exhausted emotionally and physically, was sweating profusely, and I’m still shaking as I’m typing this. It is currently 5:05 am and I have not slept. I don’t think I’ll be able to. Since I don’t have anyone else to talk to I figured I’d come on here and share my story.

1750758792,"Which med, supplement or substance helped you being more sociable and talkative?","Which med, supplement or substance helped you being more sociable and talkative?  I suffer from depression and social anxiety since I can think. Diagnosed since I was 15. I already tried many different meds as well as therapies but still nothing was able to get my symptoms into control or make me functional.   Social anxiety is the biggest issue as it‘s additionally the main cause of my depression.   Just thinking about the next days or years makes me depressed because of the thoughts how to get through that social event, that chat with a friend, that meeting, that career path, that romantic relationship and so on because EVERYTHING has socializing in it.   Socializing affects every aspect of life. My brain chemistry hinders me in every aspect of socializing making me very restricted. Being aware of these restrictions in every aspect of life (career, love life, friendships, sports, hobbies, passions etc.) makes me very depressed. Depression again feeds the social anxiety by zero energy, motivation, drive, anhedonia and so on.  What meds helped you the most with being better in socializing and also having more fun and drive to do so?   Please be aware that I already tried following ones: - 2 analytical depth psychological therapies - 1 cognitive behavioral therapy - SSRI/SNRIs: Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Duloxetine - DNRI: Bupropion - Neuroleptics: Promethazine, Quetiapine - Tricyclic: Amitriptyline - MAOI: Moclobemide - Benzos: Diazepam, Lorazepam - Gabapentinoids: Gabapentin, Pregabalin - Others: Mirtazapine, Opipramol, Hydroxyzine  All were without any success in symptoms. Except for Pregabalin. But it‘s still not helping 100% or making life bearable - aside I don‘t think you can use that daily anyways.  Would love to read about your experiences and success with meds for sociability when suffering from depression and social anxiety or any other conditions.

1750734704,22 years old with health anxiety,"Hi I 22F have anxiety most of my life, but up until this last year never had a lot of issues with it. It all sorta started when I started drinking more when I turned 21 and experimenting more with drugs. I got really into snow and was doing very heavy drinking benders for the majority of my 21st year. Eventually about 4 months ago I got clean from snow and started working at moderating my drinking. Since then I’ve been having episodes of sudden chest pain, trouble breathing, dissociation, back and neck pain, almost like gasping of breathing and absolute impending doom. First time it happened I had 2 drinks and started feeling impending doom and trouble breathing, I was shaking and weak pacing around my apartment for hours before giving in and going to the hospital where they did a EKG and found nothing wrong with me. At that point I was hoping it would be a one off but the anxiety just kept progressing. Maybe once a week I’d go into spells of breathing issues for hours and hours then eventually tire myself out enough or take myself to the hospital. I’ve also started getting random hives from what my friend who’s a psychologist is possibly anxiety related. The breaking point really was when I went to visit my partner in Alaska where he lived a hour away from any medical center and was having them every day one even over eating an English muffin. But worse and worse some with no reason but stemming from thinking I’m having an allergic reaction or heart attack. Most “attacks” last hour and only start calming down when I hit two hours after eating when there’s no possibility of allergic reaction or eventually become restless enough to sleep it off. I’ve tried hydroxizine, weed, adivan and quitting drinking completely. I feel like I’m burdening my partner and everyone in my life. I can’t help but google my symptoms and self diagnosis. I’m scared to be alone in case it isn’t anxiety but I’m scared to be around people to dampen the mood. I can’t help tell my partner is pulling away, I’m debating on doing therapy but I feel like I’m gonna overthink it. It’s almost like my anxiety mimics what I’m afraid is going on with my body.

I have pets and take care of them and play with them. I garden and get a large  and I watch tv and read and knit. I am currently working on my masters and am doing great with that.  But I just have this feeling of doom and I am behind in life. Like we are all doomed anyway so what’s the point. I try connect with new friends and people and find myself not. I feel like I am not important in the grand scheme of things. I am no one’s first choice. No one reaches out. I have to invite myself to things. I have had no long term boyfriend and am terrified I’ll never find someone. I’ll never find a man who wants to have a family but also loves me for me. I’ll never own a house. Or be able to pay off my car. I am afraid that my job will fire me even though I have done nothing wrong. I’ll never meet my professional goals even though I am actively working toward them. I am never the first choice to call about something or some adventure. I am afraid I could disappear and no one would notice because I am just replaceable in everyone’s eyes.

I just do it and get no reaction. I don’t talk to anyone for a week and no one questions it. Despite talking every day to them most of the times.  I do enjoy my life and am okay a lot of the time. I am in therapy and have tried. I try so hard to not feel this way. But I feel like it never full clicks and I feel like for years I do good and this sinking feeling starts up again.

1750727299,Panic Attacks?,"Anyone have any helpful tips for panic attacks in the moment?   (F34) and I have had them in just about every setting where it’s somewhat formal and quiet for about 20 years now. So, classes, meetings, weddings, funerals, even plays, graduations, performances.. I think you see what I mean. And oddly enough it doesn’t matter who I’m with or what the people are saying or even if I have to speak, etc. it’s more just the idea that I can’t leave (or it would be embarrassing/people would notice and then therefore if I sat down and thought again “oh god I’ve gotta leave”, it would really be noticeable if I left again). All very irrational, I know…  What’s also odd is that I’m an elementary school teacher and while I’m alone with the kids, teaching, it only very rarely happens. If the thought occurs to me, I will start to panic but usually something distracts me well enough or I just suffer through it.   So, thankfully bc I was afraid to run out, or leave class, meetings, weddings etc. for so many years, I have done a TON of exposure therapy. And I of course take meds, but I’m trying to move away from them as I am way too reliant on them and have started to experience some withdrawal symptoms when I taken them a little less than normal. And I’m trying to get pregnant! I’ve tried deep breathing, in for whatever, out for whatever (can’t remember, haha) and that did help a bit, but not fully.   Sorry this was so long!

Since I was a kid, I've always been extremely afraid of being outside, especially on my own, being with someone else makes it easier, but still. So I have almost two months before starting next semester, it's already been a couple of weeks and I really wanted to take this opportunity to go out, get a job, and make better use of my time, instead of being in my room all day everyday for the next two months. There are things I wanna do, like going to a concert and having fun. I really like metal so I wanna go out and meet friends in the local scene and such. My problem is, I'm extremely afraid of going out, and just the thought of it, especially if there's no specific reason, feels like I will look suspicious, since I can't just sit there in a park and do nothing, I don't know where to look, as I have problems making eye contact and such.

I wanna go out and get a job in a city nearby (45 min on bus, probably like 20 in car), but the problem is, the schedules would be tough, since they rotate schedules, the last bus to my town is 10:30 pm.

1750703861,The stoner life is not for me,"I'm one of those people who never listen to other people and only learn through experience (ie: the hard way). Two months ago, very early April, one of my friends told me that he had started using edibles from a recently opened dispensary. Up until that point, I'd avoided weed because I do not trust anything sold on the streets.  I decided to buy some on his recommendation. They were 1:1 CBD/THC hybrid edibles. The first time I took one, I had a brutal experience. It lasted 10 hours and I went from giggly to paranoid to hearing deep guttural breathing when alone, and then bliss.  I should have stopped then. I didn't. I continued taking them, justifying the bad experiences because I also had really good experiences.  This month, I decided to try Indica because I heard they provided a more relaxing high. They don't. In fact, these edibles are so much stronger that I have begun to dread taking any. I went from using one a day to one every few days, and now I nearly have a panic attack when I feel the effects coming on.  My OCD is unbearable when I am stoned. When I was a child, I had a strange fear of flowers. I would have intense intrusive thoughts of them coming to life. I grew out of this, but THC brought it all back. Certain images will cause me to jerk away in terror. I just can't. I don't know how to explain it. This doesn't happen to anyone else.  If I am home alone, and I know I am alone, I will be super prone to panic. The less said about night the better. If I am stoned after dark, I will feel dread like no other. I might have a panic attack thinking that it is dark because I am underwater, in a sinking ship. I'm not joking. That's where my thoughts go.  Hearing voices happens about 30% of the time, but it happens enough that I hate it. That deep, wet guttural breathing I heard the first time was accompanied by a feeling that I was being watched by some kind of entity. I was too scared to re-enter the home by myself.  Last week, I called 911 and went to the emergency room because the experience was so intense. This used to happen on a bimonthly cycle because my anxiety was so bad (and that was without weed involved).  The cognitive dissonance has been crazy because when people talk about weed, they prioritize good experiences and almost glorify the use of it. The dispensary workers told me that certain ""strains"" were better for anxiety. They're not.  The only source that gave me any kind of neutral, unbiased opinion was ChatGPT. It told me what my outpatient prescriber refused to. Every time I brought up weed, it would tell me to use extreme caution.  Well, I'm listening now. Today, I tossed the edibles.

We have a great relationship and truly love each other. However I find myself stuck with constant thoughts about her past sexual relationships and minor drug use (mostly cocaine). She’s slept with 9 people and I’m somewhere in the 40s, it blows my mind that this doesn’t bother her.  This all started probably 2 months ago. I became obsessed with thinking about a past partner of hers that I have known my whole and life and share mutual friends with. Started with worrying about what he might think or say about her and myself. This then turned into mental images, her leaving a bar with him, her being at his place and them having sex. Will think about this all day until I completely exhaust myself and eventually break down.  Early on in our relationship we both shared our experiences with different drugs. This was something I was comfortable with and it didn’t bother me until a week ago. Before I go into this I want to be clear, she is in no way addicted to any of these things she has done (ket, coke, mdma) and they are no longer part of our lives. Last week a friend of hers was telling a story about when they did coke in a nightclub bathroom. This sent my brain into overdrive!! The mental image of her in a nightclub bathroom snorting cocaine has been burning in my brain for days on end. It’s obviously not a deal breaker for me as I myself have dabbled with certain substances as well. Find it so frustrating that the mind can be subconsciously so hypocritical.  I’ve expressed all these thoughts/feelings to her and have been very clear that it is not her fault and is a me problem. She assured me that she would do whatever it took to help me and suggested that I try therapy as my parents went through a rough divorce in my teens and I’m not in contact with my mother at all after her affair became known to me.  This is someone that I want to be with. She’s caring, kind and most importantly supportive of me.

1750733327,My Life Doesn't Look Anything Like I Thought It Would,"It's summer right now. It's early in the morning where I am. The first little bits of light are coming in. Everything still looks blue, but it's not dark anymore. It's the kind of sunrise you only get in summer where it's almost dark but not dark at the same time.  There's a smattering of birds chirping. Not many, but a few. And the rest of the world is quiet. Asleep.  Opening my window I was reminded of a moment just like this one. From back when I was 17.  I remember I was sleeping over at my first girlfriend's house. But I couldn't fall asleep. I spent much of the night reading ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay."" It was summer back then too and I remember looking out her window, out at the trees and the street. And seeing that same early sunrise. That seem blue world. Hearing the quiet of the world, the scattered chirping of a bird or two. As she was laying next to me, head burried into her pillow, sleeping.  It came back so vividly to me opening my window. And it just reminded me of a whole lot of things.  Back then I was just getting out of high school. I was going to go to college for the first time a month or two later. I had a girlfriend. Friends. I was young. A new chapter of my life was starting. I was more optimistic than I had been in a while about everything. Things seemed to be going better.  I had all of these ideas what my life would look like 10 years from then. I'd have a masters in psychology from my university. Maybe be pursuing a Phd. I had starting writing a novel for the first time. I wanted to complete that before I got out of college. I thought me and my girlfriend would probably be living together. Maybe married. Waking up next to each other like this every day.  But my life turned out nothing like that.  Me and that girlfriend broke up a few months later. My social anxiety and performance anxiety would proceed to make me stop going to classes about halfway through my first year of college. The friends I had, except for one, would all drift away. I would spend the next few years isolated, depressed and unable to go to college.  Eventually I'd find a psychologist who helped me. I'd start going back to college. Started to overcome my anxiety. Found a new girlfriend. Things were starting to improve. Then the pandemic hit and everything collapsed again.  I had to drop out of college right before graduating due to a mental breakdown. My girlfriend broke up with me. I couldn't find a job. And my book still wasn't finished at all. I fell back into a depression.  I still live with my parents. Still don't have a job. And while I found another girlfriend for a while, by now I'm single again. And that book still isn't done. I don't have the masters degree, let alone the Phd I wanted. No house.

1750715135,Too Much To Decipher,"Mostly thinking aloud but also open to tips/tricks/advice. I'm a 29 year old female, only med right now is Adderall for ADHD; diagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder 11 years ago.     My old therapist once told me that my body will tell me I'm anxious before my brain will. Ever since late last night, I've felt nauseous and shaky, and I can tell it's more than likely due to anxiety. But I have so many things going on that could be triggering it, I'm not sure how to overcome/calm myself or what to do.     One thing could be that yesterday my husband and I drove home from a weekend visit to my parents' house and had a hard conversation on the way home. We are all good and it was by no means a fight, but scenarios we discussed to prevent a fight in the future. There wasn't really a resolution involved but there really couldn't be given we were speaking in anticipation, not reaction.    Another thing could be that when we did get home, I got a bill from the company we have our solar panels loan through. Apparently our ""promotional period"" ended which I didn't know was happening and now our monthly payment is supposed to be $200 more than it was before, which we absolutely cannot afford right now. It's partly due to a mistake on my part and I feel awful. I've reached out to the company to see if we can make an agreement to a more affordable (but still higher than what we used to pay) for the next year until circumstances change (a debt will be paid off finally) and we can afford that payment but am waiting to hear back.    Yet another circumstance is that we leave for vacation\* on Monday, which has me worried, too. I always get a little bit of a general anxiety before we leave on a trip. My mind doesn't spiral as much anymore but if I had to put words to why I get that feeling I would say it's things like worrying about drowning at the beach/my son drowning or getting hurt at the beach, car accidents, our dog running away (he's coming with us, but if he were staying at a kennel or with a friend, I'd just be anxious about that too), and more. \*Also, please be kind. I know I just put about how we can't afford an extra $200 a month bill, yet we are going on vacation, but we have had this booked and been setting aside money from side-hustles (AKA, not guaranteed income) for months on end for this AND my father-in-law is coming and helping with costs too.     In addition, I present at a conference on Thursday. I can't decide if I'm more nervous to present to a really small group because no one wanted to choose my session or just to present in general. This is my first time presenting to teachers who may not work for my school. I also had a hard time at school this year and am switching grades/schools in the fall because my old school/principals always made me feel incapable and stifled any creativity or leadership I tried to show, so I guess I feel like I really have to prove myself at this conference.     I've tried to distract myself via multiple of my usually helpful means such as reading, writing, cleaning/checking things off my to-do list, etc. but nothing is making this feeling go away or abate at all.",Anxiety,anxiety,3158.0,0.0657165750915751

After seeing all the propranolol reviews I knew I had to try it and my pscyhiatrist gave me 10 mg. Took it for about 2 weeks and I would say yes, my heart rate decreased and I felt a little calmer but it was not all that, that everyone made it out to be like a miracle pill atleast in my experience. At one point I even took 2 in one day of the 10 mg and didn't feel that much of a difference. Told my psychiatrist I didn't really feel it as much hoping she would up the dose but instead she recommended escitalopram oxalate 5mg which I think is lexapro. I never wanted to take SSRI's because of all the negative experiences and because I never thought of my mental anxiety as overwhelming enough for me to take medications for the mental aspect.

1750717847,how learning emotional intelligence helped me manage anxiety in relationships.,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share something that’s really helped me with the anxiety I often felt around relationships.  For a long time, I would get caught in cycles of overthinking, fear of abandonment, and feeling desperate for reassurance — especially with partners who weren’t fully present or emotionally available. It created this constant emotional rollercoaster that fed my anxiety and made it harder to feel secure, even when things were calm.  What helped me most was learning about emotional intelligence — not just recognizing my feelings, but understanding why I felt that way, and how my past shaped those reactions. It’s taught me how to set boundaries kindly but firmly, communicate what I need without fear, and most importantly, how to stop confusing chaos and drama with love.  I wrote about this process in a chapter of my ebook, which dives into breaking toxic patterns and building emotional safety with yourself and others. It’s been a game changer in calming my anxious mind and creating healthier connections.

1750714520,Anxious about sleep and it’s horrible,"Hi everyone,  So a bit of a back story - I don’t have insomnia I have anxiety when it comes to sleep.  My worry is that I will be so anxious that I won’t sleep for days on end (it has never happened) and I feel ridiculous because I have not gone more than 20 hours without sleep.   About a year ago my doctor prescribed me zopiclone that I take sometimes to help me fall asleep.   Last night I woke up at 3:30AM now I’m worried about being up for 20 hours if I’m still awake by 11:30pm and that the anxiety will cause me to be awake an additional amount of hours.   Can anyone re assure me that this anxiety won’t harm me? And that eventually I will always fall asleep no matter the anxiety?",Anxiety,anxiety,691.0,-0.016666666666666653
1750692407,30 years old. Battling Anxiety. No idea what to do with my life.,"I have had some of the worst anxiety of my life in recent months, and also a lot of life changes that have made me realize I am not where I want or need to be with my mental health. I have always considered the possibility that I suffer from anxiety, maybe even depression, but never did much to improve because I would usually always pull myself out of it. But lately it has been hard. And I don’t know what to do.   I feel like I am in a rut and wanting to do something else, I have been a supervisor in my position for years but I do not feel like there’s much more room for growth in my field, and everything I’d like to do for a living (audio engineering, video editing/production, music, etc.) just seems so unrealistic to me and out of reach, especially in my area. I wouldn’t even know where to start, and those would seem better suited as a hobby at this point. I haven’t even began learning how to do things I’ve wanted for years(since high school) because of this. I have just been coasting at the job I currently have and feel like it has negatively affected me.  While it hasn’t all been bad, have also recently purchased a home with my girlfriend, which I am very grateful for and feel fortunate to have. But even then, I have done nothing but worry about home repairs and potential issues coming up. It’s an older house, we’ve already had to fix things, and I haven’t gone a day without worrying since buying it, I know panic and buyers remorse are normal but it is taking a toll.   There is a job listed that I have until Friday to apply for, I am considering it, but it is a different field than what I’m in now. I’d be moving from doing security for an office, to a mail clerk/office assistant job. It is a step up in pay and has better benefits, but it is a different office environment, and I am just really scared that if I did happen to get it, I’ll have trouble learning to adapt, losing the job, and then the house. I’m in such a secure place right now at work it’s making it hard to justify, even though I know I need to start having more upward trajectory and learn new skills. It has just made me feel like I’m stuck at my job.   In between then and now I contracted covid as well, which is what I was thinking what may have caused the extreme anxiety and mood swings in the first place, but after over a month I just can’t seem to shake it. I just feel trapped and helpless, despite having things generally going well at the same time. It doesn’t feel right to have such positive changes in my life, better living conditions, owning a house, great relationship with someone I genuinely love and want to be with for the rest of my life, and also be at such a low point mentally and emotionally. I keep trying to tell myself that I’ll pull myself out. It’ll get better and easier, but it hasn’t. I feel like I should just be doing more.",Anxiety,anxiety,2862.0,0.07251833200812792
1750640818,Let’s normalise how severe health anxiety can really be!,"Hello everyone! I (F 22) have been experiencing probably the most extreme health anxiety I have ever had these past few months and thought I would share my experiences to hopefully provide comfort to anyone going through the same thing to let you know that you are not alone no matter how terrifying and real this all feels <3   For context I have been living with anxiety for my whole life. I always remember being a child at school and would often have to sprint out of the classroom most weeks as I thought I was suddenly going to throw up. I remember the teacher would always shout at me and I felt so scared and confused about why my body was like this - little did I know this was just the start of my battle with anxiety. About three months ago I fainted when I was out shopping with friends, followed by sweating, shaking and nausea - I had never fainted before so this felt very serious and VERY REAL, I thought I had some incurable cancer or brain tumour but my friends managed to calm me down and distract me for the rest of the day . I went to a&e the next day as the dizziness continued and I was convinced something was terribly wrong. As the nurse checked me over I fainted again in the hospital - I thought this was truly the end. The doctors seemed concerned over my heart rate - I think it was around 160bpm and they gave me IV fluids and lots of blood tests and then a scan of my heart - all came back normal and I was sent away - it was anxiety they said. I didn’t believe them though.  The dizziness continued constantly for every day. Then I developed breathing problems - it felt I was suffocating, like I couldn’t take a full breath, like a big elastic band was constantly squeezing my lungs. I looked in the mirror and swear my lips had a blue tinge. By this point the dizziness had already made me avoid going out of the house so I would just lay in my bed gasping for breath, waiting for my brother to come home from work so he could find me unconscious in my bed and call an ambulance. I thought I was dying of lung cancer or heart disease.   This suffocating feeling slowly became less frequent and I kind of forgot about it. Then I developed stomach pain and back pain and severe nausea that would just hit me out of nowhere and have me hunched over the toilet for hours - yet I never actually threw up. I googled my symptoms. Lower back pain and stomach pain meant I had ovarian cancer now. One of the symptoms I read about was needing to pee more. Now suddenly I had to pee every half an hour. I went back to my parents house so they could look after me. I ended up having multiple panic attacks over my symptoms and practically screamed at them to take me to a&e as I knew I was dying - the pain was so severe. I went to a&e, more blood tests and they said I was perfectly healthy.   The week after I had upper back pain and diarrhoea. I googled my symptoms and thought I had a kidney infection and was convinced I was on the verge of going into sepsis. Back to a&e again - I was fine.  After this I began to experience depersonalisation and derealisation constantly. It just came out of nowhere and suddenly nothing felt real, part of me thought I  had actually died in hospital that night when I fainted and I had been a ghost ever since - everything felt so distant and hazy. All I could do was curl up and cry. It was truly the most lonely and terrifying thing I have ever felt and I knew there was something wrong with my brain. A few nights later I had chest pain, palpitations, shoulder pain, and left arm pain. Now I knew I was having a heart attack. I read on Reddit how a guy said he felt so dissociated and unreal before his heart attack hit him I knew I was going through the same thing. My parents refused to take me to a&e this time and I cried and screamed at them like a monster. I didn’t sleep the whole night as I thought I would die in my sleep if I did. But I got up the next and the pain was gone and I was okay.   The next day I woke up from a nap with a mild headache and suddenly felt like I was going to throw up. I was having a brain aneurysm. I ran to the bathroom and checked the size of my pupils, I SWEAR one was bigger than the other. I refused to sleep that night despite how exhausted I was because I thought again that I would die in my sleep.   This is some of what I’ve been through in just a few months. My days are filled with isolation, constant body checking, googling - I’m talking all day on my phone googling symptoms and illnesses. Taking my blood pressure and temperature every few minutes, refusing to sleep from fear of dying in my sleep and daily panic attacks triggered by my symptoms.  Although I have no real resolution for this, I feel like recently I have began to at least play with the idea that everything I feel could all be in my head. Going from a heart attack to a brain aneurysm days apart is pretty crazy. Hopefully this can make some other people feel less alone as well and I just want you to know that I feel your pain, your fear, loneliness you are not alone. Sending love everyone <3",Anxiety,anxiety,5083.0,0.007270671834625319

I overthink every single bite, and I feel as if I have “forgotten”.   It initially manifested that I was afraid I was going to choke, so I would be scared to eat anything, but now I feel like I have overthought eating to such an extent that I can’t workout how to be carefree and just chew and swallow food naturally.  Does anyone have any tips or advice that could help me trust that I know how to swallow? I tend to take very small bites, and just chew for much longer than I need to, as it feels safe.  I’m about 4 sessions into therapy which I think has helped in part, but I’m just stuck with trying to not overthinking swallowing, I haven’t been able to go out and eat, it’s affecting my relationships with people as they don’t know how to help, and I’ve just started losing interest in food.

1750709693,Can't stop thinking about my dorm,"So I'm going to college in the fall and was assigned a double occ shared bathroom dorm maybe a month ago (meaning two rooms inhabited by two people each connected by a bathroom). Everytime I think of my privacy being invaded specifically in this case I have suicidal and homicidal thoughts cuz I've never had to share a room before. I'm practically an only child cuz my siblings are at least a decade older than me and ive never lived in the same room as someone ive only had one sleepover (which went terribly) slept in hotels/vacation areas like a cruise I went on slept next to my parents cuz I was a scared little boy and my friend had to beg me to visit his house and I always dreaded it. My privacy is the center of my comfort zone and when its invaded for long periods of time in my own room I panic cuz thats pretty much all I got. I can eat drink sleep game watch tv scroll my phone jork it rage talk to myself and more comfortably in my privacy. If I have to share a room then I cant do any of that comfortably knowing that someone can see me.   Anyways I keep getting emails from housing about selecting a move-in appointment and I just have to tell them ""not happening unless I get a single occ"" (obviously more professional than that but you get the point). The last thing i need to do for the accommodation is to give them documentation of disability (_____ has X Y Z and its very difficult to deal with) which I will do tomorrow during orientation and then wait I think a week for the final decision. Also I'll mention (most) of this to my therapist wednesday (only seen him twice and I'm scared he'd break confidentiality if I said im gonna kms if I have to share a room)  Ughhhhh it just feels like I'm on death row just waiting for the chair in August.",Anxiety,anxiety,1770.0,0.03298992673992674

Like..... what am I supposed to do with this dang sleep anxiety. And the fact that the melatonin I use, my usual alternative at the moment, is starting to falter now is scaring me cause like.... what am I gonna do the next night??   I get super anxious and performance anxiety when I try to sleep sometimes, my heart races and I can feel it the whole night, my head's too loud with mindless chatter, my body starts to run hot and uncomfortable, I get restless/anxious when it takes too long and I can't manage to fall asleep. I'm so tired of dealing with this every few weeks, and then having it get a little worse and worse with my anchor (the melatonin) starting to fail me and not giving me the same strength as before.   Even more annoying, my relatives look at the whole thing with indifference cause a period of insomnia is something everyone goes through.   Sure but.... most people manage to sleep something throughout the night when dealing with insomnia, at least 3 hours. I wouldn't be so freaked out then. In my case, I just can't sleep (maybe only half sleep since I keep my eyes shut the whole night) and with *any* luck, I sleep in the morning.   I'm probably not all that special, no. But every time it happens to me, it feels like I'm the only one going through specific stuff. It feels like no one around me understands the concept of sleep anxiety.   I hate sleeping, I really do. Genuinely wish it wasn't a necessity and I dread nighttime every time my insomnia has kicked in. By the time 3-4pm comes, I can feel that dread. And time goes too fast for me, it goes way too fast and I'm constantly checking.   A lot of the times, I'll have decent sleep for a few weeks and it's fine, then the anxiety kicks in one night, maybe when I don't do my usual strict ritual of sleeping (which is probably not healthy in itself but), and it ruins any hope of sleeping and I'm all messed up for a few days. With a borderline mental health crisis of anxiety and depression (from lack of sleep), cause I'm terrified of not sleeping, but then the anxiety of not sleeping keeps me awake, among the other symptoms. It's a nasty, vicious cycle.   I read online that once you stop caring so much about sleeping/not sleeping, sleep comes easier.

First thing is bad sinus issues! Facial pain and post nasal drip. Hoarse voice at times. Second is my Dr said I have kerritosis pilaris rubra, it's really bad on my right arm and thigh. For two years now my right arm stays red but if I get hot or anxious it gets very red and warm. It freaks me out! It's my whole arm even my hand and fingers get red. Third, I sprained my ankle about 3 months ago, I have sprained my ankles many times growing up. But this time it was different, it did hurt and I heard a Crack or snap noise when it happened. But it didn't swell up bad at all or bruise. Only a little puffy around my ankle bone. Well 3 weeks later I went to work and my foot felt weird! Tingling and stinging. I looked and my foot from the middle of the top down my toes was bright red swollen and hot! I freaked out! Dr did xray and ultrasound and also had me tested for PAD! Peripheral artery disease. Everything turned out normal. My blood work was good also. The swelling and redness only lasted about a hour, after I put my foot up and cooled off it was fine! We'll its been about a month and today it happened again! Idk what's going on! It's freaking me out. And forth, I'm having spotting after sex and after straining, I have ibs-c. Now I do have a cervical polyp so not sure if that can cause it. But all of these things are driving me crazy! I feel like something bad is wrong! Like cancer or lupus or ms! I also have bad facial flushing and my face gets really red and hot. I have spasms in my legs, arms, and stomach allot. I kno anxiety can cause allot of symptoms and weird feelings but not all of my problems can be anxiety. I kno for a fact it don't cause redness and swelling. Idk I just can't take much more! I have a few swollen lymph nodes in my neck that have been that way for over a year now! They haven't gotten bigger or anything but still can't be normal. I just want a Dr to tell me I'm ok and they did all the tests they could and everything is fine! But it takes time to get in and see a Dr then have tests scheduled and then more tests. It's just very overwhelming! Sorry for the long post I needed to vent. I've had allot of tests already and nothing showed up.

For many years, my panic attacks and anxiety spikes always include this sensation in my chest I can never really describe well- it’s painless, not really pressure and not really tingling or burning, it’s almost like I feel nauseous but in my chest instead of my stomach. My doctors have always said that this is likely palpitations (harmless- I have had a few instances of benign PACs but heart is totally healthy despite my cardiac anxiety).   Can anyone relate and/or describe this better or is this just me? I feel ridiculous describing something that terrifies me whenever it happens and yet feels like such a vague description that it can’t sound important or make sense to anyone.   PS just FYI, my symptoms are always the same- this feeling plus I get hot, feel short of breath until I calm my hyperventilation, often have one restroom trip for sudden diarrhea/loose stool, feel like I need to leave wherever I am, oh yes and of course sheer terror and certainty I’m about to die. Sometimes my heart rate rises as high as 120 and no spikes as high as 150/100 (both usually totally normal) but other times those stay in the normal range.

However I do have extreme health anxiety mainly about my stomach (but about other things like arm pain I’ll convince myself is a heart attack every time and the list goes on) but the stomach anxiety is getting crazy!

My doc is not overly worried and has just suggested a repeat in 2 weeks after I come back off holiday, and given me SimAlvia Tablets to try.  I cannot shake the fear something is seriously wrong like cancer. Even despite the negative fit test and my doctors (seen many) not being worried.

1750619646,Anxiety about death is seriously starting to ruin my life,"Hello.  About 3 months ago, my father passed away from a glioma, and since that day, I (18M) developed a sharp fear of death and disease. I reached a point where every single pain is interpreted as a tumour or something terrible. For example, when the left area of my chest hurts, I think I'm having a heart attack. When my head hurts, I think I'm having a cerebral tumour. The main problem is that these different fears led me to skip nights of sleep. I keep thinking that if I fall asleep with a small pain, I'm surely gonna die. I can't even plan vacations or anything with my friends and family because I always think I'm dying or I'm going to die soon. I tried to seek help from a therapist, but after many sessions, I'm still deeply impacted and scared, and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.

1750678278,Almost had a breakdown over making a phone call,"I have to make a phone call today to my driving instructor just to ask a couple of things to be sure, because my memory tends to forget things or mislead me unless I write it somewhere. It usually should take a minute or two, right? Well for me, as for a person with social anxiety, it always takes ages. I just wasted almost 2 hours sitting in my room, all tensed just to stare at my phone and try to force myself to finally press that goddamn dial button with my shaky hands. I tried to calm myself down several times, but the anxiety hit again as soon as I was going to call, before (as the title says) almost having a mental breakdown, just because of a phone call I still have to make. All of this effort for nothing.  Right now I'm trying to rest because my head feels drained from all of this. I'm going to try and attempt it again in a couple of hours, but I'm still so upset about myself. I'm about to turn 20, thus entering the actual adulthood. How the fuck I'm supposed to function in the future like that? Imagine trying to make a doctor's appointment while you feel like you're about to go nuts, just because of interacting with another person. I wish I could just simply dial, do what I have to do and hang up in a moment, instead of wasting time to literally press call and stutter as if I couldn't speak properly.

On Wednesday, June 11th, I had a psychotherapy session and brought up a topic that clearly overwhelmed me — and since then, I’ve been completely non-functional.  I’m experiencing all the symptoms of anxiety — panic, sweating, hot and cold flashes, trembling, nausea, heart palpitations, etc. Normally, I’m a happy person, and usually happy with my life, and I’ve never experienced anything like this before.  It’s been going on for almost two weeks now and it’s not getting any better. I can’t sleep, eat, or go to work.  How is it possible for such intense anxiety to suddenly hit me like this — especially since I’ve never really struggled with anxiety before? I’m scared and don’t understand what’s happening, which is why I’m reaching out here.  I’d really love to hear from you — has anyone experienced anything similar? Did it last this long for you too? Did you end up needing long-term medication, or did it eventually pass on its own?  I love you all and if it wasn't for you guys i wouldnt even know its anxiety 🫂❤️",Anxiety,anxiety,1128.0,0.1909090909090909
1750704717,My anxiety always ruins my relationships.,"I was seeing this guy for a month and he really liked me and things were going really well. He was going to leave on a trip for three weeks on Sunday so I wasn’t going to see him for a while, so the previous week we had plans to hang out a lot. On Thursday, he randomly canceled our plans and didn’t reschedule and wasn’t really texting me back. I started to freak out and texted him a bunch asking when I would see him. He asked me to stop texting him so much and told me he’d get back to me later. But uncertainty of not knowing the next time I’d see him and not knowing where we stood made me so anxious I couldn’t eat for several days, I wasn’t sleeping well, and the physical symptoms like the pit in my stomach and the weight on my chest made it impossible for me to even get out of bed and do literally anything else. Turns out, he was going through something and was also busy with a wedding. Despite knowing these things, I did not leave him alone. So from Thursday to Sunday I texted constantly asking to call or to see him just to try to figure out what was going on. Finally, he sent me a message saying the way I was acting was unacceptable and ridiculous and we should end things.  He was right. But the thing is, my anxiety was so bad and the only thing that made it slightly better was trying to get a response from him, and I was so desperate to stop feeling that anxious that I was willing to do absolutely anything including bombarding him with texts when I knew he was busy/not in a good headspace. I was not capable of handling my anxiety any other way.  This always happens. I always get anxious to the point where I can’t control it and end up ruining everything. It doesn’t matter who the person is, how long I’ve been seeing them, or anything else about the situation. The second I feel like I don’t know where we stand or the second I’m asked to give space I get so anxious that it affects my physical health.  I already know I need to go to therapy and stay away from relationships until I get this handled.  I guess I’m asking for any general advice for when anxiety is that bad? I try to distract myself but the physical symptoms are so bad that they serve as a reminder of the anxiety so distraction doesn’t work. Breathing exercises are a hit or miss.

It was a band I knew some songs of but i really liked thier music and considered myself a fan. And the evening started fine but I didn't want to push my opinions on a subject people talked about , also I didn't know where to walk, my friend was talking to someone and I didn't want to walk next to the girls since I didn't know them and thought that would make them uncomfortable.  When the show started i realised i know like 4 songs and was embarrassed i even went because they all knew them. The concert was 10/10 and I really enjoyed it but couldn't stop thinking how I don't belong near them and when it was over I just went out because I thought they to will but they stayed and managed to get a picture with the artists and I absolutely hate I wasn't in there.  Even worse they created a group to put the pictures in and invited me and it's like salt to a wound. More so because i really liked one of the girls but I just don't feel like I even deserve to be a tought of thiers.

I think I’d like to work in a more non profit setting or work as a researcher in a gallery or museum or other arts organization. I also wouldn’t mind taking on another admin role eventually that allows for a hybrid schedule. I just keep thinking that I should have stayed at my current job and thought through my goals for longer rather than leave at the first opportunity. Though I keep reminding myself that the job had stagnated, the hours were unpredictable, the pay was bad, and management could be horrible I am so worried that new job will be suffocating. I am worried that I won’t be able to have the flexibility in time off that was one of the only reasons I stayed at my old job so long or that when I learn of my benefits after six months I’ll hate them. I have already started putting out other applications but it’s mostly the fact that it’s like obsessive. Like if I don’t check the job board every few minutes I can’t think straight, or thoughts that I need to leave the new job because I have a feeling the benefits won’t be very good considering that PTO allowance isn’t disclosed until after 6 months.

But for years after that I was still able to have fun, cope, and move around the anxiety. But these past few days have been getting bad. I take medication called Fluoxetine at 20mg. The starting dose for Fluoxetine is 10mg. I have been off this medication for a couple of weeks since I got out of school for summer break. Yesterday, I took the pill again but at the 20mg dose. A couple hours after that I got my period. I've been asking my mom to call the phychiatrist to see what's up but she refused.

1750685847,Globus Sensation/Throat tightness adventures,"I'm just gonna make a post to vent a bit and see if anyone can relate.   I've fallen back into the rabbit hole of health anxiety. For the most part and past 6 months, it's been focused on throat feeling tight or closing/getting obstructed.    It used to be mostly a tight feeling constantly, but I've had some good periods on and off.  What consistently seems to set it off is movement? Taking a walk longer than 10 minutes, sitting on a bus or driving a car with vibrations. It's like the neck/throat starts feeling tight or closing, or as if something gets ""dislodged"" and starts blocking things.    Except nothings really blocked and I can breathe and swallow as normal, it just feels as if something is tightening and its rougher to speak and brain starts shouting ""danger""   When it happens on a long bus ride or otherwise, I can usually distract myself with some high focus requiring games or similar on phone and most of the discomfort seems to go away.   I probably also have rather tense neck muscles from bad posture or subconsciously tightening shoulders I guess, and wonder if it's worth looking into some form of physical therapy or similar things for it.  I realize this post is a bit of a mess since I'm a bit of a mess myself while writing. I don't really expect any replies, but I guess I just wanted to write it down anyway.   To summarize what I've learned about it and what helps:  Triggers it:  - Walking outside, car or bus rides, possibly being in an unfamiliar enviroment where I don't have access to my normal distractions or aid.  - Some drinks or foods that make throat feel ""clogged"" with air bubbles like soda. - Probably any kind of soreness or normal discomfort that brings focus to the throat, such as straining my voice  Helps: -Sitting down/relaxing with laptop, playing games that takes high amount of concentration or focus -Sipping warm drinks, tea mostly -Laying down, raised feet, calm breathing exercises. (Sometimes) -The good old reassurement from doctors or professionals that is doesn't sound like anything but anxiety   I'm wondering if anyone has any experience or insights regarding this. Either throat tightness in general or specifically those kind of things happening when being active like walking or being in an unfamiliar environment.  I'm specifically kind of annoyed and curious why it seems to happen specifically with activity or just walking outside. I'm aware it's probably a bad loop of anxiety and negative reinforcement since it has happened before, but it's still just...weird to me that it almost always happens like clockwork after a certain amount of time walking outside.",Anxiety,anxiety,2638.0,0.07539987789987788

About 2 months ago i started panicking really bad in my last relationship when i couldn’t even be around my ex without panicking to the point of feeling like i was gonna pass out, seize or something, having to pour cold water on my neck, insane shaking, and feeling like something is severely wrong with me. after her and i broke up that stopped for the most part.   But about 3 weeks ago i was at work and suddenly out of nowhere i felt it the worst i ever had. I felt like i was gonna faint, I was nauseous, dizzy, my vision went fully into a kaleidoscope my left ear was ringing, my chest had pressure, and i felt extremely weak like i also had to poop or something. I went to the hospital a bit later and they did an ekg, chest xray, and blood work and found nothing wrong other than that maybe i ate gluten in my gluten allergy but they couldn’t tell me that.

I went to the hospital in an ambulance a week later as i felt all these symptoms like i was gonna pass out or worse, and they said the same thing after an ekg, xray, and that my blood work said i might’ve worked out a bit too hard recently (which i had the past week) but they still didn’t have an explanation for the other stuff other than anxiety.

1750695587,Worried about being judged for preferring to make female friends as straight man,"I’m a 22 year old man. I currently have little interest in dating or relationships or anything that comes with them.  At this moment I don’t have very many friends. Most of the time in social situations (work, university, meet-ups with people etc), I actually enjoy socialising with women much more than men (and yes, I feel embarrassed about this). Honestly, I find socialising with women more enjoyable. I actually wish I have more courage to pursue friendships with people as opposed to just chatting to people. I’m anxious of the fact that if I’m caught making friends with some women then people are either judging me as gay or a womaniser - none of these are true. I’m worried what my parents are thinking (I still live with them). I’m worried about what other men are thinking about me - whether that be being suspected of being gay or a player. In reality I’m the opposite of a ‘player’ and feel as though I have little interest in sexual relationships (I’m not asexual though).  Because of this (and other unrelated stuff I’ve been worrying about, mostly job security), I just feel deflated due to loneliness some days and I’ve spent hours some days staring at my bedroom wall and not even wanted to get out of bed. I live with my parents still and they keep saying that I look tired, anxious and as if I’m generally hiding something.

1750681662,Do I have a personality problem or do I have social phobia?,"Recently, I was scolded by my friends because I am afraid of socializing.    I am afraid to say hello to people I know or people I am not very familiar with but know. If I see these people from a distance on the street, I will avoid them (sometimes even take a long detour), or not say hello. I will wonder what if I say hello but they don’t say hello, or if I say hello, will they think I am pretending to be familiar with them.    When I was in high school, I didn’t finish an exam, and I needed to go to the teacher during lunch time to continue the exam. Then the teacher gave me the test paper and asked me to go to any class and ask the teacher inside if I could take the exam inside. I walked through many classes, and even many of them only had teachers inside. But I always stood at the door for a while and then left. I didn’t dare to go in and ask. In the end, I found a corridor to take the exam in hiding.    When I pass by others on the street, if they are laughing, I will guess in my mind whether they are laughing at me. Is my outfit funny or something else.    Before attending various events, I will also anticipate various possible scenarios and then get nervous.    When I am afraid, my heart beats very fast, and sometimes I blush very much, and my neck feels very hard and dry. Then I may be speechless for even very simple questions.

My anxiety since upping the meds has been almost unmanageable, constant spiraling, losing sleep, just all around feeling miserable constantly.   My doctor wanted to switch gears, so they told me to go ahead and quit the buspirone, and they are starting me on 1.5mg of Vaylar tonight. I guess I was just wondering if there’s anyone else who has gone from buspirone to vaylar, and what there experiences were like? What was it like getting off the buspirone, I should also note I take 60mg of duloxetine in the morning everyday as well to pair with the anxiety medication.

About 8 weeks ago, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro 10mg, and honestly, it was the worst experience of my life. After starting the 10mg dose, I noticed this growing psychomotor agitation — it was getting worse day by day, along with completely zero libido.  The stress reaction never really went away, the muscle pain stayed the same, I couldn’t sleep, and I felt like I had endless energy. After talking to my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose down to 5mg, but I still feel the same way — and now even the brief moments of joy or mood improvement are gone.

She couldn’t tell me what was wrong, just kept asking me if she is safe. She proceeds to tell me she is worried that she would snap and hurt herself or the kids and explains that she would never do that but other mothers have and they probably said the same thing. She said she doesn’t have thoughts of hurting herself or anyone else, but kept saying that maybe she was crazy. I was at a complete loss on what to do. I used to be a paramedic and had my fair share of calls with panic and anxiety attacks but I felt at a total loss on how to help her. I kept trying to reassure her and tell her she was safe.

So this time I want to help some of you dealing with anxious thoughts. I saw so many posts about ww3 fear because of the recent escalations.  The thing is we are chronically online and with cheap internet we kinda now know each and everything happening in the world. And people love to sensationalize any event happening in the world.  I am no expert in geopolitics but I have noticed the pre-internet era conflicts are not much talked about.  Israel conflic has been going on for decades now. There was a time when the whole middle East got involved.. A time when Egypt was extremely powerful but that did not trigger a world War.  Another example is the decade long iran-iraq war that again saw foreign players taking their shot in it but even that wasn't ww.  India-pakistan? Kargil was one of the biggest wars fought that saw both countries being supported by different nations.. Again not a ww.  Now coming to another important point.. We now live in a nuclear world where everyone knows that shooting nukeswould be beneficial for no one.. Politicians want power.. They want to rule.. If everyone dies then what's the point? you can't rule a barren land. Also for a war to happen the world needs two sides.. We don't have that.. Everyone is dependent on everyone.. Your enemy is your friend's friend.. And your friend is your enemy's friend... It's tooooo confusing.. you cannot pick sides and lose your strategic economic partnerships.. Now we don't know what the future holds but there is a sort of guarantee that war is beneficial for no one.... I hope this gives a little peace to your mind..

It feels like something heavy in my chest with pressure, if that makes sense. The sensation can last for hours, and sometimes I get up and walk around or take a shower to try and help it a bit. It is worse at night when I know that if I have a heart attack, no one will know until morning because I am sleeping alone in my room. No pain at all in the sensation though. The first time I got this weird sensation I went to urgent care, got an EKG, and they said everything was fine, but it kept happening.   I decided to quit vaping after vaping for 6-7 months because I assumed thats what caused it. But after a week vape free it is still happening. Went to urgent care again and they said that I am super low risk for heart diseases, despite being overweight, and that I should cut caffeine. They also gave me a prescription for hydroxyzine (an allergy medicine that works for anxiety.)   The medication doesn't really work, even though I think the issue is that I have bad health anxiety. I take it when I have this sensation but it doesn't really do anything. I have an appointment with my primary doctor in about a month (that was the earliest they could get me in) and am hoping to talk to my doctor about everyday anxiety medication and/or taking tests to see if there is an actual issue.

I hate that people automatically assume it’s due to laziness when in reality it feels there’s a huge mental barrier that I’m struggling to overcome.  I want nothing more than to have a job where I feel comfortable in my abilities to just do my tasks and head home, however, every job in my area seems to be very front of house related. For example, waitressing and care home jobs.  Last month, I managed to work up the courage to get an interview at a warehouse as I’ve heard it’s quite anti-social and repetitive work but both of those aspects ironically felt like it suited me as I’m not the best with people and I am a person who prefers predictability and routine.  However, after two interviews and a whole month of back and forth communication, I got rejected. Naturally, this honestly crushed me as I thought I was finally able to get my life together.   Now I feel like I’m back at square one and my confidence is at an all new low and I still feel anxious about it all as I genuinely feel so useless compared to everyone else my age.  If anybody has been in a similar position or if there’s any advice on types of jobs that is best for someone who has very bad anxiety, please feel free to help me out here. :(",Anxiety,anxiety,1278.0,0.05540584415584415
1750664511,i just want my life back,"hello this will be long but i just need some support to get this out of me.  ihave always had anxiety and health anxiety but this month it has reached a whole new level. 2 weeks ago i went to the er with dizziness (not vertigo), imbalance (my body falling while standing if i don’t use my strength), they did some blood tests, cardiograph etc and didn’t find anything. next day i was back at the er cause i also had chest tightness so they also did an echo and a thoracic xray. all came back clear. next week after that i’m in the er again cause i fainted at a lab where i went for some extra blood work (also came back fine) and then vomited and had nape pain. they kept me there for the night cause i had an mri/mra which i was scheduled to do since my ent asked for it. came back clear. the following day i went to my ent again who sent me to do some tests at the audiologist. the tests showed i have unilateral vestibular hypofunction by 21% in my left labyrinth. this helped a lot because i finally got a diagnosis and my ent prescribed me betaserc for this along with ompranyt. the day i went to my ent i also had some weird feeling in my right leg/knee. it’s not a painful feeling it’s more like i feel like my right leg is slightly heavier than my other leg, i figured it’s from basically walking close to nothing these 2 weeks and also since i haven’t been to the gym in over 2 weeks. i started light walking around the house and garden yesterday. while walking i also felt my right arm slightly heavier than my left, i woke up today at around 5am cause my right arm was hurting, specifically my elbow and extending towards my hand. ofc i panicked but i also tried some things to see if it would help (what helped was massaging my right shoulder and traps and kind of bending the arm so that the lower and upper part sits together). i now woke up with stomach pain (which kinda went away after going to the bathroom) but when i wiped (sorry gross ik) the color was like dark green which i read can come from iron supplements (which i took one 2 days ago). the thing is i was thrilled to finally have a diagnosis for what’s going on but now i seem to have something new bothering me almost every day which makes my anxiety spike up and make me think “oh the doctors must have missed something in the mri/mra” this type of stuff. I was also prescribed ametriptyline 10mg once a day, by my gp who i went to before the ent (he also said something about my blood flow to the inner ear through the ultrasound he did). I do want to start it but i’m just scared of any of the side effects especially mixed with everything else i will start taking (definitely will start the meds by tmr). idk i guess i just need some advice or support, thank you if you made it this far.",Anxiety,anxiety,2771.0,0.06301469847981477

1750627446,Aren’t I too old for this??,"Hi everyone, I’ve always been a silent participant on Reddit, but I have a question. I’m 29 and have only ever suffered from the occasional social anxiety, but I feel like once I turned 25, I started becoming so hyper aware of things happening in my body that I convince myself I have all these issues that I don’t actually have. For example, I’ve recently become hyper aware of my heartbeat, which of course makes my heart beat faster and then I’m convinced I’m on the verge of a heart attack. I can also feel that my sports bra band is too tight (it isn’t) which makes me believe I can’t breathe even though I’m fully able to take a deep breath and that also makes my heart beat faster so I guess my question is this: did I develop anxiety at the ripe age of 25 or do I need to see a doctor?? I should also mention that I do see a doctor annually and I’m healthy, however I don’t exercise nearly as much as I used to so that could also be it, but idk lol I feel like if I were to become an anxious person, it would have been while I was growing up (like my best friend who legitimately has anxiety).

A few years ago, I had a major panic attack that really shook me up. Ever since then, my vision has never felt quite right, even though I’ve had two eye exams and now wear glasses.  Both eye exams went well — I felt like I could see clearly during the tests, and the glasses helped a bit… but not completely. Things still often look slightly blurry or off, even though the prescription should be correct. It’s not like I can’t see, but it’s like my brain isn’t fully “processing” what I see. Almost like there’s a mild haze or detachment from the visual world.  Some details: 	•	This started right after my panic attack, so I really think it’s connected. 	•	My eyes seem physically fine, but something feels wrong with how I’m seeing. 	•	I sometimes feel like I have to “try” to see, especially in busy environments or under stress. 	•	Bright light or overstimulation makes it worse. 	•	It’s not full-on visual snow, but more like fuzzy, unfocused perception, even with glasses.

1750641134,My Anxiety Story,"from as far as I can remember I have always had anxiety. When I was younger, it was triggered by large crowds, loud music and a lot of overstimulation (which I still deal with sometimes now). I would go into complete panic when being put in these situations, I would cry and scream and my mind would think of the worst thing that could ever happen, would happen.  As I grew into my teenage years, I had pretty bad social anxiety, nothing crazy, but I was very shy, awkward and timid, hating talking in front of people, found it hard to not believe that everyone was judging me, staring at me, mocking me. especially considering I was a bit weird and not the most attractive person either.  Then now. A year ago I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever experienced, it came on suddenly, but looking back, it was slowly creeping up. I kept having awful thoughts that I was going to choke on food, every time I ate, I would be terrified I was going to die. One night, I was eating some sweets and chilling with my boyfriend and then boom ! I’m spiralling into a panic attack, running around the house telling my sister and nephew that I’m scared I’m choking (even though I’m speaking and breathing fine) I was convinced I was going to die.  After that night, my panic would go on, I couldn’t sleep, eat, go to work, I was stuck. My anxiety started to show as health anxiety, I would have terrible thoughts about my health and about dying, any small symptoms I had I would panic and start all over again.   Over the past year I’ve started to slowly get better, I have my problems here and there but I know there’s always hope.

1750637588,Panic attacks about antibiotic,"So I struggle really really badly with health anxiety and OCD and right now I’m on an antibiotic for a bad staph infection.  The medication was making me a little dizzy so I googled if that was normal (which it’s a common side effect) but then it also said it can be a sign of a more serious side effect that causes increased cranial pressure and lead to blindness.  Well where I live at right now it’s averaging about 97-99*F and 91% humidity which high heat and humidity have always given me sinus pressure and dizziness.  So now I’m sitting here panicked trying to decide if I’m dizzy and have a headache from 1) a normal medication side effect 2) the weather plus medication or 3) internal cranial pressure.  I called my doctor and he’s like just look out for visual signs like blurry vision or loss of vision or visual snow- well Sometimes my vision gets weird during anxiety attacks too so now I’m sitting here overly monitoring convinced it’s happening.  I’m trying to calm down and be rational. I need this medication because I’m allergic to the other antibiotic used to treat moderate staph infections, and my staph is doing so much better. I literally only have 6 doses left to take and I’m done.    It’s such a rare side effect and I really think it’s probably the weather mixed with my medication but then I’m just unsure if my vision is different and I should be worried. But I can’t keep rushing to the doctor every single time- I’ve seen my doctor 5 times this month. I even got a CT scan for appendicitis that I didn’t have.   I’m in therapy and working with OCD but I’ve just started the OCD protocol stuff and the anxiety is just being an absolute beast. I just need to be rational and I’m failing that and I’m driving my family crazy with my continual worrying.",Anxiety,anxiety,1780.0,-0.01629113717823395

1750646780,I suspected PTSD but was diagnosed with GAD,"As of last year, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Autism. I had already suspected Autism, but the former sort of caught me off-guard. I didn't go around saying that I totally had PTSD or anything, I didn't even count it as a self-diagnosis--just a hunch, I suppose. But also not really? One of my special interests is psychology, so I genuinely did a LOT of research before realizing that I may have PTSD. Scouting for disorders wasn't even my intention when I started learning about mental health, I simply wanted to improve my life and understand myself better.  To elaborate, I've also experienced prolonged, excessive childhood trauma that lasted for over a decade. I'll spare you the details, but just know that things weren't going great for me in any aspect of my life. My symptoms aligned almost perfectly with what was required for a PTSD diagnosis, and I also HEAVILY related to nearly everything I heard from people who did have PTSD. From behaviors to emotions to even how I processed basic information. So, I was taken a bit by surprise when I was instead informed that I had something else. Not that I didn't know of other trauma-caused disorders, but it just wasn't what I was expecting, I suppose?  For further context, I do not have frequent flashbacks, nightmares, or anything of the sort. But I did have them when I was younger, VERY often. However, I waited multiple years before asking my mother for a diagnosis, during which I genuinely had a very strong recovery. I still feel proud (and a bit bittersweet) when I think of how miserable and scared I used to be in comparison to how much happier I've become. Don't get me wrong, I'm still traumatized; I can't argue with my mom in any situation, it causes me so much distress and usually leads to panic attacks. But I don't have many flashbacks nowadays.  So I'm sure that this all sounds a bit silly, but I'm just curious I guess. Has anyone else here experienced something like this?

I’ve found that I’m only really finding comfort from my boyfriend and living with my family. I’ve never felt dependent like this before, and I’m not sure if it’s healthy to rely on being around my boyfriend to feel okay and at peace for once. It’s scary, I should be a capable adult and I keep having a crisis  My anxiety has been coming out in flares. I get over one thing, and now I’m scared of another thing. It’s been awful. But the fact that I come out the other side and return to myself has me thinking maybe I can just push through? It does feel really isolating and I’m scared I won’t be able to function on my own. I need to be with my family and my boyfriend, but that’s just how I feel. I have to be functional for my final year of university coming up, I’m worried I’ll crash again.  Should I try therapy? Is it okay to be dependent on others or do I need to change that? I do have a psychologist who’s helping with my autism diagnosis and I’m not sure if I should talk about my anxiety.

1750640777,Anxiety and Heart Sensations,"Hello,  I am 23F and 3 days ago I felt these two heavy thumps in my heart that took my breath away followed immediately by what I believe to be my first ever panic attack. Air hunger, feeling like I was going to die, etc. Went to the ER and they did tests and found nothing. Today I went back to the ER because I was having those thumps/flutters a lot more frequently and had another panic attack. I was there for about 5 hours and the whole time they had me hooked up. More tests, same results. Which is to say nothing is seriously wrong with my heart. Which of course I’m glad to hear, but even while they were monitoring I would have these thumps/flutters. It kind of feels like when your stomach drops on a roller coaster except in my heart area. They didn’t pick up any PVC’s the whole time I was hooked up. I explained to them I was still having the sensation despite them saying they weren’t seeing anything. They gave me a GI cocktail and anti-nausea meds and sent me home. I have an appointment with a PCP tomorrow and a cardiologist appointment on the 8th of July. I really don’t know what to think or do. I’ve never had something that affects my daily life in such a disruptive way before. I’ve never had something so scary that it leaves me with thoughts like “what if this is forever, what if this is my new normal?” I miss just 4 days ago when I felt completely normal. The sensations are worse when laying down but happen when I am sitting and standing as well. I also feel what I can only describe as a tightness in my chest. I also have a hard time sleeping or fully relaxing because of these sensations in my chest. Feeling hopeless and powerless. Doing what I can and trying to remind myself they didn’t find anything scary both times I went to the ER. I have been extremely anxious about the Iran/Israel stuff and doomscrolling a lot more frequently the last several weeks so I wonder if it’s related and it has just hit a cumulative point.

1750640233,Why are good therapists so impossible to find?,"I have been in and out of therapy and medication management for 5 years and have never had a good experience with a therapist.   My very first session ever the therapist tried to psychoanalyze me, claiming to have found my issue immediately. He hyper fixated on me mentioning that I regretted missing my sister plan her wedding because I was halfway across the country working a job I hated at the time. He told me I was resentful of her and subconsciously didn't want her to get married, and that if I didn't move past it I would end up never speaking to her again. My sister who I love, was maid of honor to, and now dote on my newborn nephew, but sure, I'm resentful. He would not drop it, would not let me get another word in the entire session.  My second therapist forced me to take lamotrigine despite me telling her it made my anxiety skyrocket. She was convinced it was the perfect medication for me, despite me telling her again and again that the first time I took it my anxiety got so bad I couldn't drive because I thought I would wreck, couldn't leave my home for more than an hour or two because I was convinced my dog would die alone at home, and often couldn't even eat because I was convinced I would choke and die. She flat out told me she would not prescribe me anything else until I agreed to try the lamotrigine again and document in detail my side effects. She wanted me to keep a journal and write down the date, time, place, and what I was doing during every panic attack because she was convinced something other than the drug was causing my anxiety to spike and she wanted to find a pattern. She was also incredibly racist and trauma dumped on me about how (pardon the crude statement) her daughter was ""r*ped by a d*rty ill*gal."" An absolutely disgusting thing to say in any context, but especially to a patient. Obviously I never went back to her after that.  My most recent therapist absolutely refuses to take any notes, and therefore I have had the exact same conversation with her during every visit. She rushes through the appointments (supposed to be 15minutes, but none have been over 10) continues to have my dosing of my medication wrong, and does not document anything. I currently take a very low dose of my medication, not because I barely need it, but because it makes me dizzy (buspirone is KNOWN to do that) so I can only take it at night before bed. Otherwise I'd be dizzy during the day at work. I've told her this at every session, and yet our most recent one she had the gall to tell me she thinks my anxiety is improving because I'm lowering my dose. She then refused to sign an ESA letter (I'm moving and have a dog) because she thinks an ESA is unnecessary because said anxiety is improving.   I just don't understand why good therapists and psychiatrists are so impossible to find. Have I just had the worst possible luck and managed to find 3 absolute duds, or is this a universal issue?

1750621062,Super anxious about an upcoming dental appointment,"Hi all :)   For the longest I can remember, I've had a fear of anything medical related. I'm petrified of needles, hospitals terrify me and dentists especially leave me feeling incredibly anxious.   When I was younger (15 at the time, 25 now,) I had a very traumatic experience with my last dentist. They were incredibly unempathetic, made a point of showing me the needle and were unfortunately very heavy handed during their procedure during a filling that hurt me physically. This caused me to fear the dentist and I never went back for an appointment.  Some months ago, I found decay on my wisdom tooth. I'm usually pretty good with my dental hygiene, but I guess I wasn't getting to that area in particular as well as I could have. I bit the bullet and booked in with a new dentist, because I'd rather not get an abcess and it's the right thing to do regardless.   I guess I'm just terrified. My appointment is next week (it took a few months for my appointment because the UK is pretty dire rn,) and I cannot stop thinking about it. I'm expecting to be told the tooth needs to be removed, it's grown in at an awkward angle (towards the cheek, fully breached,) and they'll probably say because of the difficulty of cleaning, it's the best option... I'd much rather a filling, truly. The needle is gonna happen anyway but I really don't want to go through an extraction due to my fears.  I guess I just need some support 😅 and if there are any dentists here, all the better. I have brilliant support from my family, friends and partner, but sometimes it's nice to get an outside perspective.   Thank you all 🫂",Anxiety,anxiety,1613.0,0.18461188237050302
1750620690,I have a blood test coming up and I’m worried I’ll have a panic attack,"Hello, this is my first post on Reddit and I just wanted to ask for some advice as I have a blood test coming up in a couple of weeks that is causing me immense anxiety.   I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for around six years, but just over a month ago I had a severe panic attack and I haven’t been the same since. Every situation, such as getting on the bus or even going outside the house, causes a panic attack.   I have talked with my therapist about this, but the last session I went to I freaked out outside the room and spent our entire session having waves of anxiety so bad that she’s suggested that we stop in person sessions and move to online due to my reaction to being in public.   Anyway, that’s just a bit of background, my problem is that I contacted my gp with some symptoms I’ve been having (not to do with anxiety), and they requested a blood test in just under two weeks. At first I felt okay about it, I have no fear of needles or blood, but over the last couple of days my anxiety about the situation has increased.   I believe this is due to the fact that I’m afraid even being in the waiting room will bring on a panic attack, and I get even more anxious if people see/talk to me when I’m in that state. My panic attacks in themselves make me feel nauseous, though I have never thrown up (that’s another massive fear of mine), lightheaded, shaky, and like I can’t breath.   I’m terrified that I will get into the appointment and will have a panic attack, and therefore not be able to get a blood test, which will only worsen my anxiety as I’ll feel as if there’s something wrong with me I’ll have missed the opportunity to find out what.   I would really appreciate any help/advice with this as I want to make sure I can do this appointment without freaking out and leaving, and I really have no hope in myself that I’ll be able to be calm enough to have the blood test.",Anxiety,anxiety,1911.0,0.03222222222222223

1750629968,Possible Syncope Episode,"Hi all,  I posted this in AskDocs, but I’m still spiraling and could use some reassurance. I have GAD and health anxiety.   Yesterday, I fainted and vomited during a movie. I had a migraine most of the day, but still did some yard work. It was really hot outside and I felt a little nauseas, but that cleared up quickly. I had an energy drink before that, and a Gatorade after. I have not been good about drinking a lot of water…  A few hours later, I went to the movies and had some alcohol (~2 drinks), and some popcorn. I felt very full, like my food wasn’t digesting. About 2/3rds into the movie, I started to feel extremely hot and tingly, and started to get tunnel vision. Next thing I knew, my wife was asking me if she should call an ambulance because I vomited. She thought I fell asleep at first.   Ended up in the hospital, EKG, labs, chest x ray, head CT scan all normal. The ER doc gave me some referrals to a cardiologist and a neurologist to follow up, so I’m setting up those appointments.   Thinking back, it’s possible this happened a few months ago. Exact same symptoms while I was on a plane, but I came to while I was starting to vomit. The only difference is I had more to drink that time (nervous flyer).

1750616008,health anxiety,"i’ve struggled with health anxiety for the better part of a couple years now. it all started after i noticed a swollen lymph node years ago that never went away. multiple doctors visits, intense rumination, fear, crying, all until i got confirmation that the growth i felt was in fact benign. this started kind of a new theme for my OCD that has just progressively gotten worse. I’ve probably diagnosed myself with every type of cancer under the sun at this point. wasted money on pointless doctors visits, and wasted so many hours going down rabbit holes on google. it always would be some weird pain that i’d immediately attribute to some type of cancer. it got so bad i’ve even gaslit myself into thinking my eyes were yellow with jaundice (they weren’t.) i thought i’d seen the worst until my mind somehow, somewhere, and for some reason that i can’t figure out made me think of neurological issues. since then, i’ve seen one of the worst mental health spirals of my life. muscle twitching, shaking, wobbliness, random fleeting numbness in every one of my limbs, tight muscles, all started happening.   i freaked out, worrying i have *** or some rare motor neuron disease. it was horrible. never had any actual objective loss of strength, but the constant hyper vigilance has caused me to second guess every normal sensation. every little clumsy mistake i’d immediately scrutinize. “am i losing strength in my hands? am i able to stand normal? why does this feel easier with my right hand than my left hand? maybe i should just test out my strength until im certain im not feeling weak”. while probably a product of my OCD, i would second guess every sensation, sending me further down the spiral. of course the more i entertained this thought, the worse the symptoms got. my muscles twitch out of control all over my body. i wake up and immediately feel my heart racing, and feel just shaky and off. the connection between neurological issues and the effect of my anxiety and imagination wreaked havoc on me.   the point i want to make is anxiety itself when teamed up with fear or our imaginations can make normal things feel abnormal. and further anxiety itself can be so powerful when it manifests physically. but feeding the loop only worsens it. if anyone else is struggling with something similar, just know you’re not alone and understand how powerful anxiety can be even physically. i’m working hard to stop feeding the loop, trying to stay off doctor google who tells me every benign sensation could possibly be (insert rare fatal debilitating disease). if anyone else is experiencing something similar feel free to reach out. it helps knowing you’re not crazy and other people are going through the same thing.",Anxiety,anxiety,2725.0,-0.048523138654717614

1750595300,Setback after accident recovery has triggered my worst anxiety. I feel like I’m falling apart.,"Hi everyone,  I'm not sure if this is the right place, but at this point my anxiety has gotten so bad that I felt the need to reach out here.  On April 27th, 2025, I was hit by a car while getting out of mine, just about to step onto the sidewalk. I didn’t see it coming — the blindspots on the small residential street hid the car. My son was with me that day, and I instinctively moved to protect him, taking the hit myself. It broke my right femur and completely changed my life. The trauma and pain caused my anxiety and depression to spiral. I was given anxiety medication in the hospital because I was shaking so badly.  I went through a 2-week rehab program and did really well in PT. I was walking again, using a cane, slowly getting my life back. But then a blood clot was found two weeks after I got home, which set me back. I had to stop everything. Once I was cleared by my vascular doctor, I restarted PT, walking again and making progress.  Then it all came crashing down again — I pushed too hard doing lunges. Now the doctor thinks I may have sprained my LCL or possibly torn my cartilage. All the rehab and pain I endured in May feels like it was for nothing. I can barely walk again. My knee swells. The pain feels different now. It's not just about the femur anymore.  I’m so angry and my anxiety is out of control. I'm constantly stuck in ""what if"" thoughts: What if I stay like this? What if I’m never able to walk normally again? What if my leg stays stiff forever? My family doesn’t understand. They keep yelling at me to “stop being so negative,” that “I’ll be fine,” and “I won’t stay stuck like this.” I know they mean well and believe in me — they’ve seen me fight so hard from day one. But it's so hard.  I’ve been fighting since the day of the accident — I walked the next day, I pushed through PT, I’ve been doing it for my children. But now I feel like I pushed too hard and broke something again. I’m starting over. I’m scared.  I have my MRI tomorrow and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m anxious, terrified of what it might show. I just wish my family could understand what I’m going through inside. I'm exhausted.  If you’ve read this far, thank you. Truly.

It feels so embarrassing that im so afraid of doing these basic things everyone should be able to do.  And I think this is really the source of my depression, especially this summer. I have no work to distract myself with and absolutely nothing to do. And when i have an opportunity to do something outside the comfort of my home I just dont do it because I am too afraid.   I wish I could just hard reset my brain and be normal and carefree",Anxiety,anxiety,1396.0,-0.04191104594330402

1750597764,Struggling bad,Hello everyone starting out I am a 27m I have had ocd since I was a child but this past year I devolved a panic disorder and severe anxiety.  I started on lexipro I was on it and did okay for about 6 months.  Like an idiot I came off the lexipro because of weight gain and thinking I was going to be okay.  Fast forward to about a month ago my anxiety came back with vengeance due to a lot of home and work stress.  I also have a prescription for Xanax for emergencies they are .5mg.  The most I have ever taken is half a .5mg most the time is .125mg. The last month I have taken it about 5 or 6 times while also trying to start new medication bursar and Zoloft. Both I stopped within 3 days because the nausea was so bad the Zoloft had me so worked up I was puking and have intense anxiety.  It's been 3 days since I have stopped the Zoloft and I have taken .125mg of xanex every day for 3 days. Last night I tried to not take anything and my anxiety got so bad me teeth were chattering and my neck got stiff and I convened myself I am having xanex withdralls and going to have a seizure.  The last week I have also convinced my self I have multiple cancers and a brain tumor.  I want to go back on lexipro but scared I'll give myself a seizure and or seratonin syndrome.  For the scope of my xanex usage to be exact I have taken 5mg total in a 8 month period. Has anyone else gone through this.  I want to be able to eat stop shaking and be normal again.,Anxiety,anxiety,1456.0,0.01921645021645023

1750526003,The biggest anxiety myth I've learned in my 16 year mental health journey,"We can't control how we feel but we can control our actions.  One of the biggest mistakes I made with mental health was thinking that it was going to improve on it's own.  **""I'm going to start exercising, getting sun, meditating, etc. - once I feel happier""**  I say this with love but sadly, that's not how it works.  We need to do the actions first, and if we stay consistent - change happens.  Luckily we can do the actions DESPITE feeling anxious. DESPITE feeling sad. DESPITE feeling unmotivated.  I also understand how crippling anxiety can feel, and if you're at that point - you're not going to do an intense workout at the public gym right away, but make the actions **so small** that it's impossible to not take the win.  * Go for a walk in the sun. * Can't do that?  * Go watch a YouTube home work out or yoga video and try to follow. * Still too hard? * Listen to music and dance. * Need it smaller? * Stand up and stretch. (See where this is going?)     **Start stacking the small wins and slowly work your way up.**  When you do the actions for long enough, one day you'll wake up and think ""oh wow, I'm not feeling as bad as I used to be"" :)  Sending you hugs and lots of love. <3",Anxiety,anxiety,1196.0,0.0652116402116402
1750617773,Anxiety over children playing,"I feel so silly asking for help with this, but I'm truly near my wit's end, and really need some methods that will help me live a happier life as I completely understand that this is a ""me"" problem.  Long story short, we live in a cul-de-sac where children play on communal land adjacent to our home. This includes playing football for which they use our fence as a goal post quite often. I've spoken with various parents regarding this and have had no luck getting it to stop, so I've had to learn to live with the banging, footballs repeatedly being kicked into our garden, repeat knocking of the door asking for footballs back, and children climbing into our garden without permission to get the footballs themselves. This has been going on for 7 years and increases in frequency in spring and summer.  I am aware of how silly this sounds, but it does become very disturbing to our lives/routines - particularly on weeknights when the children are out of school for holiday periods and can sometimes disturb us as late as 11pm or midnight when we are in bed for work the next morning. They are just children, and I fully understand this, so I have accepted to live with that.  What I'm unable to live with is the anxiety I now have regarding all of the above. I feel like it was triggered when a window of our home was eventually smashed. It was accidental, but I now live with very bad anxiety every day in my own home. I feel like it's not normal to feel this anxious from the moment I wake over children playing. I live in fear of something else happening and dread the sound of them making their way towards our house.  I've found myself in a rut of self sabotage, where I've conditioned myself to be unable to relax and enjoy things like hobbies in my own home until I know the children will be at home, in bed for the evening, and I can do what I want to do without disturbances.  Could this be at a level where I need to seek professional help, like speaking to my GP or going to therapy? I'm driving myself crazy!",Anxiety,anxiety,2024.0,-0.03375114784205694
1750617422,Something is breaking down for me,"I’ll start with I’ve been dealing with anxiety in one way or another since I was in 10th grade, now 39.  It took until about 13 years ago to get a full panic attack that resulted in the hospital visits, EKG’s, cardiac stress tests, blood work, etc.  No problems with any of that.  I HAD been in Viibyrd (stomach issues were the worst) for almost all of those 13 years until it started to wear off in late ‘24 so I started to taper and go onto Prozac.  Started at 10, anxiety still there, 20 felt much better for a few weeks but not resolved, upped to 40 and it’s like it didn’t do anything.  Worse, probably.  Now, most of my panic has been around health.  Fear of heart attack until I was able to convince myself otherwise.  Lots of bloating in the upper stomach and nerve twitches in the chest that would set off my anxiety.  This is different though… I’m feeling deep loneliness and really intense thoughts that I just can’t do this anymore.  Not that I’m “making plans” but more like nothing is ever going to help and I’m going to stay in this terrified panic phase forever.  It’s really debilitating in that I’m scared of doing any exercise, scared of playing with my kids too hard and get hit in the chest, etc.  Also, LOVE traveling and only recently have noticed how exposed I am when in an airplane, off deep in the forest with no cell signal while fly fishing, driving through the country, you get it. Another thing is it all ramps up tremendously at night so I genuinely fear when the sun goes down and I have to make my way to bed to deal with anxiety until I fall asleep. Having a few beers takes the anxiety from 1000 to absolutely 0.  Awful habit and thankfully not a problem yet as I’m really intentional about staying away from bringing that in.  Anyway, wanted some emergency assistance/hope from this group.  Should I think about switching off of Prozac even though I just got up to full strength?  Klonopin helps but hate the tolerance it builds up (.25mg 2x per day).  Also do 10mg. Propranolol 2x per day.    Just to add, I’ve started seeing a therapist for CBT because I’m determined to kill my anxiety this year but often times I just tell her my worries for 1.5 hrs then leave.",Anxiety,anxiety,2202.0,0.03227969348659002

It feels like the more and more I look at this subreddit, even though I’m diagnosed with GAD, I relate to it less and less. Everyone on here talks about being anxious about anything and everything, things that I’ve never been anxious about, like wars and storms and health and everyone has panic attacks about those things, or sometimes randomly about nothing. I often am able to look at everything analytically and logically and extinguish those fears as they rise.    It feels like the only things that make me extremely anxious is my house burning down, having to initiate talking to someone, and I always spiral about feeling like I’m a narcissist and I’m manipulating everyone around me.   I’ve thought about OCD but my psychologist told me that I don’t score a single thing in the OCD diagnostic criteria. He did however put in his notes that I have what’s called “specific phobia” and that’s a nod to my fear of fire that I’ve mentioned multiple times. I will engage in compulsive behaviors because of that fear, like not plugging anything in or counting to three before I turn off the light switch after it was only on for a couple minutes, and those type of things. I thought they were signs of OCD but the psychologist said that I needed to do it with other things and not just my fear of fire. It’s odd because I’ve never been around fire or impacted by fire.

My anxiety symptoms have been so bad that I can’t breathe, I’m fainting, my mind fog and disassociation is worse than it’s ever been, my nervous system is so worked up and it’s incredibly difficult to regulate.   due to the severity of these symptoms, I’ve been struggling with new fears like:  - fear of dying (like slipping into unconsciousness) - fear of dying while i’m alone (not being able to breathe/fainting and no one being able to help me) - fear of going “insane” (losing my grip on reality and never being able to return to normalcy, fear of not feeling connected to my body, my symptoms increasing to the “point of no return”  I know that these fears exacerbate the physical symptoms, this is something that used to happen to me when I was really young, so I know my body can trick me, but any encouragement that I am OK and that I am taking the steps I need to by seeking professional help would be so appreciated.

My anxiety manifests almost exclusively as physical symptoms and it is exhausting...

More recently I've been having horrendous symptoms with my throat and chest - that I hope are just down to anxiety but it can be hard to reassure yourself.

So on to the weed part... I'm 21 and I've been smoking weed pretty much every day since I was 16, it's always helped with my anxiety, especially the painful physical symptoms, and it's never interfered with my life (holding down jobs, studying , etc). It's a huge part of my routine, and it's always been more effective than any medication I've been prescribed... Until recently.

A week later, I ended up in ER because I had some sort of a seizure which was categorised as a panic attack.   Here I am in 2025, struggling for years to get my life back. I was diagnosed with a panic disorder, and I also have agoraphobia. I can’t go anywhere alone. I am in therapy, taking my antidepressants, doing yoga, breathing exercises, absolutely everything in my power to heal.   Things finally started to get a bit better in March. I could go out on my own for a bit, walk around my neighborhood. And then I lost my job. Everything went downhill from there. I was already living paycheck to paycheck, since I had to accept a lower pay for remote work. I had saved some money to get me through in case of emergency, but it’s about to run out.   I tried to find anything to do online, but I was rejected numerous times. I don’t have any friends because I wasn’t fun anymore after the panic disorder diagnosis. I can only talk about it to my therapist, but I see her every three weeks (because I don’t have money at the moment).   And this morning, I had a horrible panic attack. I thought I was losing my mind/control of my body and got even more scared I might harm one of my neighbours if anyone tried to help me. So I lay down and accepted that whatever happens, it happens.   I managed to calm down after 30 minutes (or so), but afterward, I felt even worse. I want my life back. I want to have friends, find a normal job (not slave remote work), go out for coffee on my own, buy groceries like every other normal person.   I am just so tired of this.

A situation with my friend happened yesterday evening and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong or not.

My friend (18F), who I’ll call Sue for the sake of anonymity, told me that I was being insensitive for feeling anxious regarding the United State’s current political/nuclear affairs. Sue told me that compared to the middle east, we are not in a war and we have no reason to feel anxious when we’ve already destroyed so many lives of middle easterners.   At first I was confused, because logically, it’s not like I’m the one telling the leaders of this country to bomb other people. It’s not like I voted for that. I’ve advocated for ceasefire and have publicly posted and voiced my opinion so it’s not like I’m just tone deaf to the world.   But, it made me feel bad. It made me feel like I don’t have a place to feel anxious or paranoid over the idea of war retaliation. I truly do feel bad for those in the Middle East that have been victims to this genocide.

1750612946,Does anyone else get nausea from anxiety? And is it similar to mine (read to see what i mean),"To start, I am not sure if the nausea I have been experiencing is being caused by a physical problem or just anxiety, but my money is on anxiety.  Since yesterday, I have been experiencing some nausea, it comes and goes, I mainly feel it in my belly but the feeling does travel up sometimes, so far I have not gagged or actually thrown up as the nausea has not been intense.  Nausea is not a common symptom for me, the only time I've ever had it was last year I believe, it was similar to what I have now, but unlike what I have now I'd actually gag sometimes.  As you can imagine, my health anxiety is 📈 at the moment. Even though I don't actively feel anxious and I am not mentally anxious, I still get physical symptoms, that's just how my anxiety is (can anyone else relate?)  To conclude, peeps who have took the time to read this post and relate to what I am having, how do you cope with it?",Anxiety,anxiety,897.0,0.0072222222222222245
1750611675,Should I complete Anxiety questionnaire from Drs? [Please read for context],"9 months ago, I reached a bit of a crisis point with my anxiety and went to the doctors begging for help. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression and prescribed Sertraline. I was also referred for NHS therapy, and upon completing the assessment labelled as a critical case.   I then waited 6 months for therapy. In that time, I started the Sertraline, and it completely changed my life. After a bumping transition phase for a couple of weeks, I felt amazing - like the best version of myself. Not at all anxious, very relaxed, happy and excited about life again.  When I got to the top of the wait list and got my first therapy session through, they sent an assessment form I had to complete pre-session. It was the same as the original one I completely when first referred, however, of course my answers were now very different. No, I didn't feel worthless anymore, or struggle to go to work, or lie awake all night having panic attacks, or have loss of appetite. BUT I still needed the therapy to help me learn the techniques to cope if the feelings came back again.  I decided to be truthful in the form and as a result, at the start of what was meant to be my first session, was told I no longer needed therapy. I was healed in the eyes of the NHS !!! They said their therapy is for critical cases and I am no longer a critical case. I said, *but I was a critical case, and had I not gone on the medication in the mean time, upon hearing I'd have to wait 6 months for therapy, god knows where I'd be ?!* but alas, they had more critical people who needed my spot I guess.  **ANYWAY**  I have now been on Sertraline for those 9 months and it has transformed my life and mental health, and giving me the life jacket I needed to build mental strength and get my life back on track.   Yesterday, I received a messaged from my doctors asking me to complete a questionnaire on my health. Upon opening it, I can see it is a similar mental health questionnaire to the therapy assessment.   Based on what happened with that, I'm a but nervous to complete it in case they try to take me off Sertraline.   Has anyone had any experience with this, and what do you think I should do about the questionnaire? Could they stop prescribing the medication against my will?",Anxiety,anxiety,2258.0,0.12346047794117651

But, the anxiety I feel 24/7 is because of my physical issues back then that always left untreated and get me worst up to this day.  I admit that I may not have a proper healthy lifestyle but it's unfair since I am just living how kids and teenagers do normally each day.  I visited doctors each year and they don't even look like they care about my condition. They kept closing the issue that it's all in my head— welcome to Philippines LOL. F I don't wanna hear the same thing anymore 'cause I can no longer move properly as the day goes pass.  I feel so tired 24/7 like literally TIRED itelf. You know the feeling of going home after a long tiring day? I feel that even with just a simple move— even right now I am just laying on bed with 24/7 palpitations without knowing the issue.  Done my x-ray for lungs, full abdominal, thyroid, cbc, 2d echo, and ECG.  I always have ECG results of Tachycardia since 2020 till this present. My new doctor assignd me to do 24hr holter monitoring device and I'm still waiting for the results.  Please help me! Anyone feeling the same? My heart feels so heavy as if I'm gonna die due to exhausting feeling. Exhausted, weak, fatigue, and so on. The new doctor treats me well atm but I wonder if he cares to the point that he do more deeper investigation about what's happening to me.  I also have issues of feeling like hbing a vertigo 24/7 idk. I feel like I'm in the water swaying and outbalance feeling.

It feels sticky and dry, like my saliva is thick, and it makes my whole mouth feel off. The taste seems to come from the back of my tongue or throat — it’s hard to describe, kind of bitter or sour, and it’s constantly there. It’s not just a momentary thing; it’s been bothering me nonstop, and I’m starting to worry that it might be something serious. No blood, no smell, i can even tell that i don't taste it on my toung.

Do other people really not having these haunting thought every single day??? Is this just what living with anxiety is like. I have had anxiety since I was a child. I was a quiet kid and as I got older I became more outgoing but it was all to fit in. I remember always feeling kind of left out and different than other people because I never wanted to go to parties even though I got invited.

1750610453,Neverending,"Im just need to get things out before my to try and decompress. I already struggle with anxiety due to a complex genetic medical condition I have, but cool, I can generally manage that. This is the timelines for the last  4 years.  -2020 stepfather died (I live on the other side of the world).  -2021 fil died Now on to the doozy,  - Mid 2023, I  collapsed at home, ambulance to hospital, admitted for tests, after 3 days on a general ward and went to sleep on the Friday night woke up Saturday afternoon in icu. My BP dropped suddenly in my sleep causing me to become unresponsive and needingcpr. (I have POTS so can cause bp issues but never anything like this before) was in Icu 10 days then on war for another week. My poor husband got THE phone call to come to the hospital immediately and I couldn't see my children while I was there. Did a tilt table test which showed my BP dropped up to 70% by standing for too long.  So recovery was fairly slow but was getting back on track.  - daughter slipped at home, knocked herself out. She was okay but it causes a panic attack  in my then 9 year old thinking he wouldnt see her for weeks.  - we found out my 9 year old was getting bullied at school by both students a the principal (very small country school. To the point other parents were ringing me to tell me what they had been told was happening to him. Got him in play therapy and just pulled him out of school early.   - bio mum arrived to meet for first time, stayed with us for a month. ( again from other side of world ). Went okay but it was  alot!  Mid 2024- - was feeling quite unwell one morning and went to my doctor, he looked at me and called an ambulance. I was blue lighted to hospital put in resus and then in icu for two weeks with septic shock. Was in a general ward for another week then allowed home. Again I only saw my kids on facetime. Recovery was long both mentally and physically. Dr's realised I had been put on a new bp medication which caused my BP to drop too low which international started liver and kidney failure.  - next 3 months were spent with weekly blood test and trying to manage my BP with tiny incremental   medication doses which we finally got right.  - MIL died  -Xmas day started great, suddenly developed a high fever, called ambulance (due to septic shock before). Was admitted to HDU with urosepsis so was there 12 days.  2025 - received a phone call from my mother that my brothers wife had collapsed and died at home. (Again other side of the world). - struggling with fatigue, pain, depression and anxiety. I usually have quite good management of these but I was completely overwhelmed.   - husband diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer. It's a case of the best of the worst news and he doesn't need treatment yet.  -got a call from my oldest sons school (16 ys) he had been attending counselling through school and he had told her he was feeling suicidal. Luckily we have had good support from our GP and the local mental health team and seem to be on a good path.  - my 10 year old son developed asthma and was rushed to hospital 2 days in a row. We have since worked out it is mainly caused by anxiety and he is back in therapy. We are also in the process of trying to get him assessed for autism as there a definite traits. The actual autism part does not bother me in the least as it's these things that make him who he is, it's the process of trying to get him assessed.  The only brightside is I managed to stop smoking and I think after going through all this and not picking them up again, I have well and truly beat it!!  Than you for letting me get this of my chess, I think I just need to get it out without causing people to worry about me.

1750596031,Perhaps some Comfort during these Times,"I've been trying not to freak out over everything. Last night I felt nauseous, got lightheaded, racing thoughts and speech, the whole 9 yards.  Then I got angry. Why let my anxiety steamroll my peace? The concerns are valid, and at the same time I cannot feel so constricted by anxiety that I cannot breathe over the “what ifs.” I’ve let it slowly drain and suffocate me for 23 years, so I’ve finally found myself submitting to any realistic, tangible solutions. I know not one size fits all, but perhaps it may help some:  The thought process that has kept me going though this is that if worse case scenario there is death, the threat of death is there and has been there for everyone all the time anyways. Forgive the cynicism, although being blunt with myself was grabbing my attention more. I could choke on my food or get in a car crash tomorrow and die. There are other unpredictable ways we could pass, and that is the daunting nature of life. These incidents could occur even earlier than the worse case scenario that we may fear from our current political climate. With that being said, my last moments would be wasted on fears of ""what if's.""   And so, I’ve chosen to aggressively, passionately and mindfully live. I went to get a smoothie and enjoyed its mango taste in full. I drove with the windows down on the highway, so I could feel the wind hit me at just the right temperature. I breathed with my whole stomach and chest, cherishing those moments alive. Nurturing my body that fights to maintain that way. I knew my existence, in that moment, for that exact moment, was guaranteed for each act.  It is now today, the day you are reading this. You are alive to read this. What do you need and want to do with your guaranteed existence in this very moment, this very second?   Listen to your body and mind. Get good food. Drink refreshing water. Pick up that book you’ve been wanting to read. Go on a run to burn the that energy. Watch that YouTuber that makes you laugh so hard your stomach aches. Finish that art piece that you feel proud of yourself for making. Play your favorite songs on your commute. Find the enjoyable moments at your place of work, like the sun pouring in, even smell of the soap in the bathroom.   Your current existence is what you can control, in an uncontrollable world. Spit in the face of fear, try your best to enjoy the gift of this moment, even if it feels impossible.",Anxiety,anxiety,2419.0,0.11082972582972583

I’m scared of even bringing it up. I’m scared of them having a big reaction like “oh we really need you here though!” Or upset that I’m leaving. I know my fears are irrational, but I also feel bad because a lot of our best workers have been quitting or transferring (we got cut hours and all that too). I’ve always been treated super well and given my best in return, so I will miss it, but it’s not the right place for me anymore.   What can I do to overcome this anxiety?

Of course there are many reasons a person can be anxious and/or depressed, but especially if these symptoms are new and there isn't a life reason you can identify, or, if you are already prone to anxiety and/or depression and it has become worse (sometimes much worse) for no reason you can really identify, please consider having your calcium and Parathyroid hormone levels checked.
