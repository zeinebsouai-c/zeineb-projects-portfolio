I have had this job for five years & it’s the first job I’ve had longer than a couple months. Has been a huge struggle but the fear of being homeless again kept me going. Just couldn’t cope anymore. I have been made fun of because of my bipolar very publicly multiple times, which was supposed to be confidential. This happened a few months ago and the way people are towards me hasn’t been the same since. Once again became an outsider

"1750762626","Is bipolar disorder that socially stigmatised?","I am starting sharing, in the attempt to normalise it and feel ok about that, that I have bipolar disorder. Most times the first reaction I got is ""oh! I know X that also has it"". 

I am not sure what to think about that. It is a normal reaction, or they are trying to make me feel ok by saying they know someone that has it, or sounds they are actually schocked and this is the consequent reaction? How would you interpret this?

Also, when dating someone, would you drop the information like I am doing now with people to normalise this condition, or better after some time? ","bipolar"

"1750789713","Psychiatrist said it was full-blown mania, not hypo?","I’m coming out of an episode that lasted about a month and a half. I was walking 15-20 miles a day, sleeping at best 4 hours a night (usually 2-3), and had heightened spirituality. I wasn’t psychotic and was pretty functional, though. My psychiatrist said that due to how ling the episode lasted, it would be classified as full mania- but I don’t know if that’s true, because I didn’t need to be hospitalized and was able to continue working/doing everything I needed to do.

My psychiatrist updated my diagnosis to Bipolar 1- I know the actual classification matters less than the treatment, but I really doubt that I’m type 1 based on this.

"1750792087","I do not.","I do not let my past define me. 

Mental illness diagnosis gives you a definition of your illness, not who you are. The battles that you have to overcome is not the ones where you overcome yourself, but the battles that you fight to overcome your illness and to be yourself. Thriving and living in a world where people accept you for who you are, and don’t judge you and let you live your life the way that you want to. We all live in a world where we are diagnosed by doctors, by therapists, by friends, by family, by people that we work with; we all have a diagnosis, we all get a prescription, but the truth is you do not have to let your past or your diagnosis define who you are. You are a human being with dreams, with goals, that wants to love and share and be part of something bigger. For me, the person that I’ve always wanted to be, I always have been, and when I look in the mirror now, I see that I am happy, I’m healthy. I have shelter. I have a family that loves me. I’ve always been looking for something that I found out as always, always has been right there, right inside me.","bipolar"

I’m not progressing towards any career goals, and my job is sort of a dead end.

"1750789603","I feel like I need to learn to be okay without friends","I’ve been recovering from a manic episode that resulted in my diagnosis and the loss of almost everyone close to me. Some of those friendships were bound to give at some point but others weren’t. 

I went out to an open mic last night and that’s when it hit me how hard it’s going to be to make new friendships with the realities of this illness. I’ve clearly taken brain damage from my mania. This plus my autism makes it extremely hard to interact with people to begin with. And that’s before I get lost thinking about my long history of hurting everyone who gets close to me. I can’t help it. I’m feeling more sane than usual right now but I’m not normal. I can’t be normal. I won’t ever be able to be normal no matter how hard I try. And even when I’m putting up an adequate facade, that’s all it is. 

There will always be major social obstacles I just won’t be able to avoid. And I’m starting to think that maybe I’m just better off alone. Maybe the people around me would be better off without me. Dozens of my former friends have come to that conclusion and they seem to be thriving because of my absence.

I’m a teacher, and my job is insanely stressful. I adore what I do, but during the school year I am usually too exhausted to do much outside of work. So I always get excited for summer because it means nothing but time to work on my creative projects and see my friends.

It’s been about 3 weeks since summer started, and I’m insanely depressed. Having very little social contact has messed me up, but I’m also so easily overstimulated that even a ten minute conversation makes me angry and tired. I’ve spent time on my art. I’ve done some writing. It’s too hot to take a hike or get outside really. I’m barely eating because I don’t have the energy to cook. I just wanna lay in bed and look at my phone. 

This is supposed to be me time, fun time, time to enjoy myself and relax. Instead I just feel so fucking sad and useless. Idk what to do to make things better, it’s been over ten years since my depression has been this bad and I don’t remember how to handle this heavy sadness in my body.

I am on meds now, but in the past I have been unmedicated manic for two separate periods which lasted about four months each. And then before that unmedicated hypomanic I believe for a long time. I feel like when I was unmedicated manic I was on truth serum. I confessed a bunch of secrets and super personal things. I even publically confessed secrets on social media. I also said other things that I regret or that were just generally embarrassing. Also when I am unmedicated I feel somewhat like another personality takes over my body. Looking back the loss of control is scary. 

This one memory I am cringing and obsessing over the most involves me confessing something super personal and controversial to my brother in public. His response wasn't very good. Then I also mentioned a graphic detail about the sexual assault my ex-boyfriend committed against me in that same conversation. It makes me cringe so hard that I shake my arms and make noises. I also sent an incriminating and embarrassing video to a lover I had during a different manic episode. I feel so violated and embarrassed that my other personality did that.","bipolar"

I was released from the psych ward today, and while i was there i experienced a lot of violent transphobia that only ended up traumatizing me more. while i was experiencing that my close friends and boyfriend worked from the outside to either get me discharged or transferred. They also took care of my cats and cleaned my apartment which i will be eternally grateful for. 
However, once i got out today they all expressed discomfort and an inability to be involved with me for a while. This was all following a pretty intense manic episode ending in a deep depression. I am having trouble reconciling with their need for space while i am still so fragile. It feels like abandonment from my support system and i’m not sure how to do any repair. I told them about my safety plan and my
enrollment in a queer friendly PHP, but they don’t seem satisfied with that plan. 
I’m just not sure what to do, and i don’t understand why my hospitalizations always end in friendship loss. any insight welcome ","bipolar"

I saw my first new psych last month since I received my bipolar 1 diagnosis, and this new doctor diagnosed me with bipolar 2.

What I experienced was no less than that, but I don't think I did the best job conveying it.

It was SSRI induced mania, so is that still somehow possible with bipolar 2 or am I just gonna have to have a conversation about this?","bipolar"

I was wondering if it’s possible to get SSDI and SSI at the same time? I’m on SSI for a disability that has been present since before my birth.

"1750796951","Just sharing. Back at work after mania, and everyone knows.","I’m not really looking for advice, I just needed to put this somewhere..

I've just recently returned to work at 25% capacity after having been on sick leave since spring. I was manic and psychotic. My mental state is still pretty up and down, but at least I'm not manic anymore. It's such a strange feeling being back at work, because the last time I was there, I was completely manic. I left behind a total chaos.

Now, being back, I get these flashbacks from that manic period and they're very unsettling. No one's expecting me to be productive during these few working hours. It's more about just showing up, getting used to the idea of eventually working like normal again.

What also feels difficult and strange is that I work in healthcare myself. My colleagues don’t know about my diagnosis, but unless the doctors and nurses are both deaf and blind, there’s no way they didn’t notice I was full-blown manic. I can tell they know. It’s that classic “elephant in the room” feeling.

And what makes it even harder is that I see, almost daily, the doctor I had a recurring “intimate relationship” with during that time. Back then, I brushed it off as “just a bit of flirting.” But no, what I did wasn't flirting. Messing around with him and giving him a blowjob on the patient examination table is something entirely different. It’s bizarre now. And I’m ashamed. I feel this overwhelming, suffocating shame.

That’s really all I wanted to say. Thank you, to anyone who might read this ... and understands.","bipolar"
"1750785283","Struggling with self compassion, loneliness, and rumination","Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 13 years ago, and OCD a year ago. 

I’ve been really struggling to have anyone to talk to about it. I am going through a depressive episode after having a mixed episode, and I just feel totally alone. 

I don’t know anyone who has both bipolar disorder and OCD. I only know one other person with OCD and no people in my life have bipolar disorder, and there are very few support groups for either diagnosis in my area. I also have self harm tendencies, but those are typically managed. 

My OCD is making me feel like I am annoying my loved ones by talking about my mental health all the time (despite them telling me I’m not), but I just keep ruminating on it. 

I definitely scaled back on talking about it except for with my clinicians. My psychiatrist put in a referral to my insure to start TMS therapy as well. 

Any words of advice or anyone have both of these diagnoses?","bipolar"
"1750766313","‘You have an unspecified form of a bipolar disorder’","Soo I just got diagnosed with bipolar. My psychiatrist is smart and has known me for several years. He said that I have an atypical case and he wouldn’t classify it as 1 or 2.

On the depressive side of things— I had been diagnosed with MDD for several years before this. My episodes are severe, dangerous, and intense, usually involving suicide ideation and some pretty gnarly self harm behaviors. Some lasted for weeks. They usually come right after I’ve been feeling realllyyy happy for a bit

My mania is a little more confusing. I don’t actually know if I’ve had a proper manic episode that lasts 4+ days, but I’ve certainly had all the symptoms. There are times where the world seems so vivid and bright and my heart won’t stop racing and I make impulsive decisions. Once I broke out of my residential treatment program thru a window and ran to the nearest bay, got on some rich couple’s yacht and jumped off into the water screaming with glee and fully clothed

I have ptsd and adhd and am very very dissociative, so it’s hard for me to understand episodes because I straight up don’t remember them

I have mood swings throughout the day where I go from thinking my life is beautiful and amazing to thinking I should end it all. He said I should be considered on the ‘bipolar spectrum’ because of my instability, but I don’t really have clear-cut manic episodes, at least that I remember. Sometimes I have a week where I just feel really happy and stable but not manic, but then I crash and get severely depressed

I recently started a new job at a restaurant. Since my last episode, I’ve been trying to un-learn extrovertedness. Biting my tongue more than I’m used to to avoid rambling or oversharing as per usual. I started this new job with the intention of being closed off and distanced from my coworkers.

Today, I brought up a few coincidences that have happened this week to one of them. One of them was abt “Crazy” by Gnarlis Barkley and I mentioned how a lot of ppl w mental illneses resonate with it. 

She tells me she has bipolar and struggled with it for years. She points out that she can tell when I switch in an out. I’ve never heard of that before so I kinda froze. She said she was in rehab for two years, got her life together, and now clean off of substances and it’s the happiest she’s ever been.

I’ve been stable for almost a year with some small symptoms but I’ve been doing very well. The conversation was brought up with kindness and understanding and the concerns he brought up are certainly valid. He reassured me he will work to learn my warning signs for episodes with my help and wants to grow together. Having children is really only a recent consideration for me as in the past I was barely stable enough to stay alive. Now that I’ve found working treatment, and I’m in a healthy relationship, it’s definitely something I’m thinking about.

And then sometimes, out of nowhere, the fog lifts. I suddenly have energy again. I feel talkative, motivated, full of ideas, wanting to do everything all at once,and it’s such a sharp contrast. 



I also have ADHD, so I don’t know if this is burnout or bipolar acting up.
Has anyone else experienced this kind of emotional shutdown followed by sudden bursts of energy? How do you handle it when you have to keep functioning while feeling nothing?","bipolar"
"1750771754","Help and advice?","Hello guys, I hope everyone is doing well.

To cut a long story short, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 around a year ago now and my Psychiatrist at the time didn't really offer much information to me about my diagnosis, he prescribed some meds and told me to do some research online. I struggled to get in touch with him for months and months and finally found out he had passed away suddenly and was left with no replacement. I have now been given a new Psychiatrist who also isn't very helpful.

Does anybody have any help they can offer with day to day life, routines, things that help make this illness bareable? I am completely at a loss and to be honest am struggling quite a bit at the moment, and definitely smoking far too much weed as a coping mechanism.

Thank you in advance for reading!","bipolar"

I really thought at the time it helped so recently I decided to get back on it and my god. I felt instantly insane my cycles were hours instead of weeks and my emotions were so out of wack, I was going from manic to depressed to so mad all in the span of hours and it was exhausting. I was confused bc i walked into work and finally recognized the fact that I was manic snd could hardly function only to finally come and realize the ssri is actually terrible for treating bipolar. Just frustrated bc it feels like I’ve lost so time and brain power and function bc of lack of proper medication and now i have to do the process of getting back off the medicine and  it’s so ugh.

Well, the past week I’ve felt my consistency derail and my energy and motivation slow down. Now I’m dreading work too and even kind of want to quit. 

The problem is,  realistically you can’t put life on hold forever to recover. But my life picks up again and soon later I’m started to feel myself slow down again.

"1750767505","advice on mood tracking?","hi - I’ve always really struggled to keep a mood chart despite knowing it’s crucial. I probably would have gotten diagnosed a lot sooner if I was consistent with it. my main issues are:

1) Sometimes can’t easily put my finger on what I’m experiencing until later or until it gets really bad. Days or weeks after it makes more sense to me so I can be like “this week I was generally in this state” and I just write that in my notes app. However the entire thing is disorganised and just reads like the ramblings of someone losing their actual mind. I feel like I’m getting dumber as the years go on and I just have no clarity in the moment of what I’m really feeling anymore.

2) I have to be in a pretty inspired mood to be able to log consistently bc a lot of the time I can’t get anything done let alone track something daily. 

3) I really like using Apple Health for everything else regarding my health so I thought that would inspire me but the mood tracker seems really inappropriate for bipolar. Because in my mind “an unpleasant day” implies sadness for most people but for me that could literally be stages of mania lmfao so the whole thing would make no visual sense on a chart.

It feels like my mind and body are in a state of total collapse, but at the same time, I just can’t shut down. It’s like there’s a motor running inside of me that won’t stop, even though I’m absolutely exhausted. What’s scaring me the most is that clonazepam isn’t even helping anymore, like it used to.

I feel trapped inside my own body and mind, incredibly uncomfortable, restless, and desperate. It’s a horrible mixture of anxiety, exhaustion, sadness, racing thoughts, and inner agitation. It’s like I’m both desperate and overstimulated, but too exhausted to function — yet too wired to rest.

I’m not sure if this is mania, depression, or really a mixed episode, but it feels like one of the worst states I’ve ever been in. It’s like being sped up and deeply depressed at the same time.

"1750702530","Medication Killed my Sex Drive","Hey all, I’m hoping to get some advice or just hear from people who can relate. I have both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. Before getting medicated for bipolar, I had a very high sex drive—it honestly felt like sex was how I reconnected with my body after years of medical trauma. It was intense, immersive, and deeply emotional. Looking back, I can see that some of that intensity was probably driven by the bipolar and BPD.

Since starting my meds, my libido has basically disappeared. I still get sexual feelings now and then, but it’s not the same. Sex used to feel like an all-consuming high, and now it just… doesn’t. It’s harder to climax, I feel stuck in my head during and after, and I don’t get nearly the same pleasure or emotional connection—unless I’m high, which obviously isn’t a sustainable solution.

The upside is that I’m not constantly craving sex anymore, which has helped me make better choices (especially since I’m not in a relationship and used to jump into casual sex too fast). But I really miss that feeling of connection to myself and my body. Sex has always been a huge part of how I experience intimacy and self-expression, and losing that feels like losing part of who I am.

I don’t want to stop my meds—have helped in a lot of important ways—but I also don’t know if I can live like this forever. Has anyone else gone through this? Did anything help? Did you find a med combo that didn’t wreck your libido or make you feel so emotionally disconnected from sex?

⸻

Over the years, multiple doctors diagnosed me with bipolar disorder—after a traumatic brain injury in a car crash at 16. I had a minor stroke and now live with a metal stent and coil in my carotid artery. Health issues have always lingered like an omen, even though I still party. I resisted the diagnosis for years. Everyone had one—OCD, PTSD, bipolar—it felt like branding. But eventually, it stuck. And so did the meds: Latuda, Lamotrigine. I’d stop, crash, crawl back.

After a brutal move to NYC, life started aligning—cool jobs, writing, friends, stretching, gym, French, travel plans. Everything looked golden. But even with momentum, depression hung and doomed over me in the background—always. Still, I clung to the good.

Then came the festival I planned all year. I go every summer—it’s where I feel free. Last year, I weaned off meds and rolled—mushrooms, molly, ketamine. It was euphoric. I felt like myself again. I wanted that back—just for a weekend.

This year, I tried to be careful. I didn’t want to fully quit meds but still roll. I obsessed—Reddit threads, friends, my psychiatrist (who warned me), my therapist (who said I wasn’t in the best place). I’ve been doing drugs since I was 14. I’m not an idiot. I tried to be smart this time, given everything. Still, I thought: half doses, skip a few days, roll “safely,” restart meds after.

By the time I arrived, I felt awful. No sleep, dissociated, anxious. I cracked and took my meds again on day two. Then I did 50 whip-its, chasing relief. When the tingling in my hands started, it didn’t stop. Panic. My parents think I’m insane for doing whip-its with my health history—and I am—but life is brutal. Sometimes I just want to kill a few brain cells. It’s on me.

I spiraled. Thought I’d caused permanent damage. I canceled the road trip I’d planned all year. Went home. Urgent care, EMG—just nerve irritation worsened by fear. But the mental fallout was massive.

I knew this could happen. I’ve gotten off meds so many times. And I still fucked it up. Now my favorite things are triggers: this place, my car, my fingers. The soul trip I dreamed of became a disaster.

"1750735343","Have some questions - recently diagnosed.","Hey everyone - I’m new to this. 
I have a mild form of epilepsy.
Diagnosed with generalized anxiety a while ago and of course, depression. 
But then it came a bipolar diagnosis - which I didn’t expect but I wasn’t surprised at all.

I hate how easy medicine labels you , but I do understand it does help at some extent.

Now that I’m more aware of my ups and downs, observing myself better on this side.

I can now relate some feelings that I thought were exclusively epilepsy related, to bipolar. 

Such as:

Rapid thoughts and endless ideation. New ideas coming, rushing. Listening to music and literally sometimes feeling so fucking good that it’s hard to explain. It’s like flying. Goosebumps is the least. I feel the rithm and sounds in my soul and my heart starts beating at a sweet spot. At the same time - I believe I have no limits. Those grandiose ideas, that damn… I know they’re fucking amazing - I believe I can do them. Sometimes, sort of my destiny. I absolutely don’t allow myself to think small. 

But… I’m very extreme in terms of - I won’t back down. I simply won’t. I will make whatever I put myself into. 

The thing is, I know question myself. What I used to celebrate. Enjoy. Embrace.
I don’t know if it may destroy me. 

But at the same time - I deeply feel there’s no other way for me. And that it’s all or nothing. 

I’m deeply into music. Creating things. Tech.

Does this make sense? What do you do with this feeling? People around me, who used to trust me and my ideas - are now hearing differently. 

I also experienced 2 psychotic episodes that were mostly triggered by antiepileptic meds. 

Apologies for the long text. 
Whatever can help - how do you feel with being bipolar, how do you manage it, do you enjoy part of it? Is there a creative upside around it?

"1750710883","Always feel lonely","I guess a bit of background but I’m 19M and recently diagnosed. I apologise if this isn’t worded the best I’m just writing this from the top of my head. Currently I’m not on medication and haven’t been before, I have been offered these but I’d need to have some blood tests and an ECG first.

Although usually my memory is quite poor between my manic and depressive episodes (not sure if this is normal since this is a recent diagnosis) I’ve managed to keep track of how lonely I feel. When I’m in that state of mania, I have this absolute feeling of grandiosity which can also further be affected by delusions (sometimes religious) making me separate myself from others as I believe they’re not as “good” as me but also in the way that I’ve surpassed what is known as a human

When I’m in my depressive episodes I isolate myself from others but not for the same reasons. I’m way too paranoid, I just believe everything and everyone is after me and that I have no privacy. I guess it’s also affected by thinking about how I may have presented myself whilst I was manic. 

Although this does concern me a bit, I understood that this could just be common symptoms of these episodes. My concern mainly comes from how it impacts me outside of this.

When I do eventually have these brief periods where Im not in these extreme episodes, I’ve noticed I still feel lonely. Although I express concern about this, it personally doesn’t affect me too much but it’s more recognising that this isn’t usual. In general I’ve become a lot less social, I can’t really initiate conversations even with people I’ve been friends with for years or even my parents/family. I don’t really care about social contact or relationships as much and honestly it’s made me go from being close friends with people to maybe speaking here and there. 

Has anyone else experienced this and if so how has this impacted your personal life? I can’t tell if this is something that can be expected or something more personal to me, either way I’m curious to hear what other people have to say about their own experiences.

1) Just talk about it and “hold space” (idk what hold space means and everyone gets mad when I ask what that means and how that’s different that feeling like a piece of shit daily) 

2) schedule a time to worry… this does not work bc nothing stops the worry. When one stops another starts. I can’t even have hobbies bc I can’t stay focus bc the worry is constant and the guilt is constant. 

3) Journaling…. I have notebooks upon notebooks and nothing changes when I write in them. Generally things get worse

I couldn’t stop crying, but at some point I compartmentalized that pain and shoved it to the back. A couple weeks ago, she was acting weird so I took her into the vet and they did blood work. To say I was shocked by the results is an understatement. We had put her on a liver medicine so I thought at least her liver would be doing better, but results show she’s in full liver failure now.. and her cancer has widely spread. When I got the phone call, I was shaking uncontrollably and ended up with a nose bleed. The stress was so overwhelming. Since finding out, she’s started showing signs of intense pain and neurological symptoms.. we’ve put her on a pain medicine that actually has helped her immensely and we’re going to start her on a med to slow down the neurological symptoms which are being caused by her liver failure, causing a build up of toxins in her body. 

I have so much fear in me that I’m not going to be able to handle losing her. She’s my best friend. My one constant through the past 11 years of ups and downs. When I’m sad, she’s by my side.

I had a friend of 8 years that I recently ended things with, and it's been really hard. I had a couple episodes and really let him have it, which I regret. 
A year ago, I confessed to him that I was in love with him. I was in a manic psychosis episode, so I also told him I was traveling through time. He ended up sleeping with me for 6 weeks. I was in the mental hospital for one week between.

He knew I was in love with him. He knew I was in a bad way.

At 6 weeks, he was acting weird, and I asked him if he had feelings for me, and he said he had only ever seen me as a friend.

This has devastated me.

When I told him I wasn't going to be his friend anymore. He cried, he was frantic, he said, you can't possibly believe I'm not your friend.

We spent the last year trying to repair things, went back to how things were before. That was a bad idea.

I couldn't get over what happened, Id freak out on him periodically. I told him I couldn't do it anymore, because he had taken advantage of my feelings.
He ended up crying and saying he did have feelings for me, and reassuring me that he had feelings for me even now. That was strange to me, and I tried not to believe him but it got in my head.

I found out he was going on a date with someone else 2 days later. It hurt and I freaked out on him for telling me he had feelings for me. He legitimately didn't seem to understand why.

He asked me if I was off my meds. And sent me a text saying, ""I care about you. Please talk to your therapist.""

Im torn between feeling like I was justified, and feeling like Im just too much because of my bipolar.

TL/DR: My friend hurt me bad, twice, and then brought up meds and therapy when I freaked out.

We ended the appointment with her deadpan looking at me going ""you almost certainly have bipolar."" Didn't say BP1 or BP2 though.

I went into the appointment kinda already having a feeling that I have bipolar because I've had a manic episode where I thought I became enlightened and ended up writing a manifesto about how I thought my music album was going to change the world, and I'm pretty sure my dad has it too because I experienced one of his manic episodes.

"1750708286","Looking for coping advice","I got diagnosed with bipolar in 2019 after a long depressive episode. I started Lamictal, which didn't work well for me. I was also on Vraylar and Depakote afterwards. I always really struggled with my diagnosis, and any time I would start feeling better, I would just stop taking my meds. Then tell myself I had been misdiagnosed. The two times I have totally stopped meds, I've ended up in a really bad place on both the depression and mania front.

I started seeing my psychiatrist again a couple months ago after I had been having some more intense manic symptoms. Intense irritability and anger, hearing voices when I'm falling asleep, other things psychosis-related like being extremely paranoid, mistrustful of loved ones, thinking I'm being watched, bad panic attacks. Prior to seeing my phych again, I had been off my meds for about 8 months. I have experienced manic symptoms before but they have gotten a lot more severe and distressing over the last year or so. The distressing symptoms come in waves along with feeling GREAT. Like my mind feels unlocked and clear, I feel like I'm able to think and process on a different level.

My psych started me on Geodon, which has helped a bit, but after a bad panic attack they decided to start me on Lithium, and I've been on that for \~2 weeks. After the first 5-7 days, I felt great. Symptoms improved, sleep better. I even journaled about how good I had been feeling. Then over the last 2-3 days, I have gone downhill. I've woken up very irritable and it will border on anger throughout the day. I feel disconnected and foggy, like I'm behind glass. And I'm exhausted. Still getting enough sleep at night but then wiped out during the day too. Wanting or needing to nap frequently.

I've talked with my psych about this, but I just want to feel BETTER. I know stopping meds has been a bad call in the past, but some of them have made me feel stuck in a gray area. I want to manage it the right way, but I struggle with finding things that work long term, or getting started with healthy habits and activities. After my previous two experiences stopping meds, I won't do that again, and feel like I've finally accepted my diagnosis.

I feel like I've never truly given it my all in trying to manage my bipolar in a healthy way, because once I get discouraged I give up and it falls apart. I don't want to do that this time. What do you find that works for you?

Eventually, when I was 17, and literally on the highest dose possible of my anti-depressants, I decided that maybe depression wasnt the answer.

After a bit of googling I looked at both BPD and BP and after much evaluation, settled on BP. I noticed that I was depressed, but not all the time.

It’s affecting my work (I’m a SWer so it’s hard to just cover it but I get rude comments on it being unfinished looking) and affecting my sex life (which my sex life is a shitshow right now for MANY reasons so that also doesn’t help) and it just makes me so incredibly sad and wish I never got any tattoos in the first place now.

"1750694422","My Wife is Stealing from Our Family","I’m Bipolar 1. I have PTS, Anxiety, Depression, ADD as co-morbidities. I’m 53 and only found out I was neurodivergent about 6 years ago.

My wife has again been lying to me for the past 5 years.

She got herself in $40K debt. On a credit card, she says. She can’t show me the bills, because she closed the account and has it with a debt consolidation company. I asked how this could happen? She says she bought food, clothes, jewelry. Stuff. None of which can she show me because she pawned it all and got close to the value. This is another lie. Pawn shops don’t pay value. Ever. She can’t answer that to my satisfaction.

I asked about why she needed to go into debt when I made over $500K in the last five years. She said she took money from my earnings to cover her debt. That explains the lack of savings. We are broke. I was so wrapped in my trying to get stable I let the reigns go. 

That has to be some fucking debt, right? Where is it all? She can’t tell me in detail what she bought. She can’t tell me how much of our money she stole, for whatever purposes. But she wants forgiveness?

I’m at my mental limit. What the fuck do I do???

She’s risked our home, our kids futures, everything and can’t even tell me how or why???

I want to just go away. End it and let her pick up the pieces. But I can’t. My kids. They need someone they can trust.

I’m making her go to couples therapy, starting this week. I’m going to force her to confront what she did.

I don’t know if 20 years of marriage is enough to save this. I’m working so hard to be better for my family. She’s stealing from us? $40K in credit card debt, but how much of our actual money did she take and spend? I’ve asked over the years why our savings isn’t where it should be. Her answers were very flippant, but I felt that being mentally ill and not as stable as I wanted to be, that I couldn’t really question her.

I’m lost.

My oldest is starting college and my wife has been pressuring her to get a loan she shouldn’t need because I made enough. Thank god I have cash stashed aside to cover the first year. And what I make this year? I’ll put enough away to cover next year. But now I’ll never retire. I’ll be in debt until I die.

What do I do?

I love her, but cannot trust her. I only asked her not to lie to me.

And she couldn’t even do that.

I divorce her? My kids will be devastated. They don’t know what she’s done. They think she’s perfect. They think I’m the bad guy because of my bipolar.

I can’t rip that illusion away. They need to hold onto something positive. 
I’m stuck. How do I dig her out of this? Not for her, but for the kids?","bipolar"

the usual “manic pixie dream girl” trope is annoying but i can ignore pretty easily. it’s when others begin to depict me as insane, despite being quite stable, that i struggle to maintain my confidence and start to crumble.

It's been over a month since we were supposed to have an appointment and she still hasn't rescheduled/keeps cancelling on me. I feel like she's just given up on me. My therapist has also been frustrated about it, has offered to get involved, and she believes I'm being neglected. I don't know. I just feel disappointed and let down. 

On the upside though, I did get an appointment scheduled with an actual psychiatrist. My past experience with APRNs just throwing cocktails of drugs at me is starting to convince me that I should find someone more specialized :/

"1750657623","Had an episode involving alcohol, and now it comes back when I get drunk?","I had a mixed episode and lost my mind. Among other things, I kept spending money and giving away free stuff, mainly purses to people. I also began to drink 1-2 bottles of wine a night, every night. 

The crisis lasted from January until March. It was my worst episode and landed me the bipolar diagnosis. I got help at an inpatient. 

However, when I get drunk now, I try to give things away to people like in the episode. I was out with friends at a bar and left to go buy as many homeless people food as possible. 

I got a bit drunk and offered purses again to people without good income online that I want (need) to sell. 

I also act more erratic drunk now than I did prior to the episode, and the hangover the next day is more destabilizing and leads me to drink again, so I’m cutting it out. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else gets symptoms from an episode pop back up when drinking?

I’m in my first relationship (23f) he’s (27m) aware of my bipolar, psychosis, SH scars, history of SA and is very supportive about it and doesn’t judge me etc. 

We’ve known eachother for about 5 months now and have been official for just under a week. 

I’ve had small phases of being a bit hypomanic and not sleeping for a day or two, I haven’t hid my illness and I’m honest and let him know when I feel that way so me being off and being more erratic, sentences not coherent makes sense.

I’ve never been able to maintain relationships with most friends let alone romantic relationships so having someone who isn’t scared of my past and issues and supports and loves me despite it all scares me as I’m not used to being accepted for me.

I overthink a lot, and with this dynamic being so new to me I’m genuinely terrified of what’s to come. I’m also worried my hypersexuality could cause issues in the relationship :”)

I feel like I’m slightly rambling saying a bunch of nothing, I can’t get my words together but what I guess I’m asking is advice and help from people who have been in relationships or are in one and how they were able to manage their symptoms and traits without hurting and destroying the relationship.

I am 19 years old and I have been struggling with it since a few years, or well my whole life according to my mom but the last year or two have been really hard. 

I’m pretty “high functioning” overall (just everyday life, like hanging out with people, school, things like that). But when I get “bad” it’s bad. I have a boyfriend who I’ve been with for 4 years and lives with me and my mom and he’s really supportive. We’ve talked about our future, like when we get married or when we have kids etc. 
And overall I’m doing pretty okay but I’m so worried about if I do have kids. How will I “control” it? Like what if I traumatize them or pass it on like my grandma (probably) did with me? I just need someone who has kids or understands to talk to about this.. My grandma had bipolar but was always an addict (hard drugs) which made her lose my mom and uncle. I’m scared to get addicted to substances, because I know I get addicted so fast which makes me never use them. But I just don’t know what to do about this whole kids stuff.

Now I'm on these anti tumor its so shit.

Also to add i am diagnosed as Bipolar 2, ocd, chronic depression, ADD, ADHD, ODD and ptsd and do have a history of psychosis (drug induced which i haven't done in over 7 years) So i did try and persuade my endo a bit to let me on it. I take the tablets on Thursday morning 250mg once per week and friday/Saturday are a dangerous time. It's flairs my mental health issues to 50x worse and I will literally be a monster if something sets me off on those days. Especially with my ptsd as I hear loud bangs or crashes mixed with yelling i go into a full 5 min psychosis and black out, I'll hit or bash anyone who sets me off in that time, I'm argumentative, I'll staunch people over nothing. My friends have literally learnt to avoid me on those days as they can see the change in my eyes.

I hate this drug but I'm too scared to tell my dr about the side effects as I'm worried he will cut me off it and I'll have no other options. I want my testosterone back up and this stupid tumor gone so I can get on with my life.

"1750655418","If you had religious delusions","So my whole life before I got bipolar 2 diagnosis I experienced cycles of anxiety and depression, y’know the usual. I have childhood trauma and neglect in my background so I was kinda needy and needing acceptance and validation since I was always so depressed and anxious and didn’t have parents to help me emotionally. But anyway I found a spiritual mentor at age 18 who was a psychic/medium and they introduced me to spiritual stuff and told me I was an incarnated angel and for years up until the age of 25 I believed this and so a lot of my cycles were influenced by religion and spiritual stuff.  I feel like it was good and helped me to cope with the cycles of anxiety and depression I was going through. Like I thought I was an incarnated angel so I made some pretty good decisions I think in terms of not going towards drugs or alcohol. The person acted like a surrogate mother to me as well. Well towards the end of this relationship the pandemic happened and it turned abusive where they were scaring me with the stuff they were teaching and I was terrified and began to have panic attacks and think dark sided things were out to get me (paranoia?). I was saying prayers all the time and having nightmares and health problems. I gained so much weight from it. So anyway, I believe I was in a cult as there were others who followed this person and i came to realize this person wasn’t genuine or “real” in their teachings in that they would mess up details I’ve told them before or say things that didn’t line up so I stopped believing they were the real deal. Anyway it was shocking and coming out of it I’ve been trying to understand this experience and what happened here. 

Was I experiencing psychosis? Like is it psychosis to have religious/spiritual delusions about being an incarnated angel. Did I experience psychosis towards the end of relationship when I was having the nightmares and panic attacks and paranoia? 

Edited to add: forgot to mention during this time I got 30,000 in debt but they told me the world was going to end and money won’t matter so I went crazy and started a business for crafts and got into palmistry and thought I could switch careers.

"1750638934","Taking responsibility of the diagnosis and learning from mistakes.","Hi everyone, I hope you're having a good day.
I wanted to share a story because it's been burning in my mind, I did something that feels like a sin.

A couple of years ago, before I was even diagnosed, I used to party with friends, consuming marijuana and alcohol. This story takes place at the birthday party of an old school friend. That night, we were having a good time—until we started smoking. Suddenly, it felt like everyone became hostile toward me.

At one point, they put a chair in the middle of the room and told me I should sit there. I did, but the chair was flimsy. When I tried to stand up, they insisted that I sit again. I was overwhelmed with negative thoughts, so I gave in—and the chair collapsed. Everyone laughed. But that wasn’t the worst part. They demanded that I pay for the chair and started asking me for money—about 60,000 Chilean pesos.

At that point, I just ran. I escaped through the city and didn’t stop until I made it home. Sadly, it wasn’t the first time something like that had happened but I never saw them again.

The next day, I couldn’t get out of bed. I felt like I should just end everything. I kept repeating to myself that I was worthless and that nobody cared. But I had a girlfriend at the time—and it was her birthday. It was supposed to be our first birthday celebration together. I had prepared a nice gift, but I couldn't even leave my room.

She started calling me, but I didn’t answer. My thoughts were: She deserves someone better. Everyone will be disappointed. This ends here.

Her last message was:
“You hurt my soul.”
You should know she had also been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I can only imagine how deeply I hurt her. I made those insidious thoughts real. She deserved someone better.

Now, things are clearer. I don’t think I’d make the same mistakes again. I quit marijuana and alcohol. I cut ties with toxic people. I try to be more careful with the ones I love.

Two years after we ended our relationship, we ran into each other in the Santiago metro. I was leaning against the wall with my eyes closed when someone touched my chest. The first thing I saw was her smile. Then she gave me a hug—and I almost cried right there.

We talked about life—about my mom, about her father. When her stop arrived, she gave me another hug and left.

What I did still feels like a sin. But the worst part is, I never told her what really happened that day. I think if we had just talked—if I’d told her about the night, about all the demons haunting me—we could have gotten through it together. We could have celebrated her birthday.

So what I want to say is this: when in doubt, communicate. Even if it’s hard. Don’t let silence destroy the things you love.","bipolar"

Could a different version of this life be possible? I feel like I need step outside of the overwhelm and try something different but truly don’t know where to start and I’m just so depleted.

Some days I feel like I can conquer the world. Other days, I struggle just to get out of bed. It’s not linear, not logical, and definitely not easy to explain to most people.

But through it all — music has been my constant.  
Not therapy. Not medication. Not even journaling.  
**Music.**

When I’m manic, I compose.  
When I’m depressed, I listen.  
And in between, I find rhythm — a kind of emotional compass that helps me feel… human again.

Music gives shape to what I feel but can’t express.  
It doesn't judge me. It doesn’t try to fix me. It just resonates — and that resonance is sometimes all I need to get through another hour.

It’s not a cure. I still have episodes.  
But when I put on headphones or sit at a piano, the chaos in my head goes quiet for a moment.  
And in that silence, I breathe.

If you're out there living with bipolar, or any mental health struggle — know that you're not alone.

But almost every night I’m woken up by these dreams. Most of the dreams involve my loved ones or even my pets. Idk what to make of all of this, if someone can relate that would be nice

I wish we used technological advances to fast track development in the poorest areas of earth instead of padding the pockets of hundred-billionaires and finding new ways to hijack human attention.

I burned bridges. I lost people. I lost myself, more than once.

But through all of it… one person stayed.

**My psychiatrist.**  
Same doctor.  
11 years.

He saw me in the ER.  
He saw me at my most manic, my most depressed, my most afraid.  
He adjusted meds when nothing made sense.  
He listened when I didn’t make sense.

And slowly — *slowly* — he helped me build something solid.  
Not a perfect life.  
But one I could stand on.

We don’t talk enough about the power of continuity.  
About what it means to have someone who knows your entire story.  
Who doesn’t have to “start from scratch” every 6 months.  
Who sees patterns before you do — and reminds you who you are when you forget.

If you’re struggling with bipolar and you feel like no one gets it:  
Find a doctor who listens.  
Stay if they’re good.  
Consistency is medicine, too.

Other strange things that I think are delusions happen to me, and sometimes everything is connected and I think I'm on a path and I knew, since I was a kid, how my life's gonna be, like flashes of it, sometimes I think I can see the future, sometimes is just probabilities that match.

"1750558841","Recently diagnosed, would like to know what hypomania feels like to you","I’m a 25F and was recently diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder.

I’ve had OCD since I was around 8 years old and had many depressive episodes in my teenage years (which by the way, I recently found out OCD and bipolar are often comorbid) but started treatment for it only at 16 years old with an antidepressant.

Last year, right before one of the most important exams in university, I had my first hypomanic episode: for a week straight, I could do nothing but study, and a there was a day I studied for 26h straight, no sleep at all. I felt as though I just couldn’t stop, as though I couldn’t do anything else, like it was out of my control. My therapist suspected I had a hypomanic episode and suggested I see a psychiatrist again.

I somehow convinced myself (and the psychiatrist) I was only very anxious about the exam, which would explain the lack of sleep and hyperfocus. She prescribed another antidepressant and suggested we observe if I would get any better and we would regularly see each other the following months.

This week though, shit hit the fan. I could not sleep for the life of me and did not feel like myself. I made a post on reddit I didn’t even remember typing, I got super into coloring books and could not stop coloring for the life of me (I’d never in my life cared for coloring books), could not concentrate on anything at all and basically felt like walking around the house all day to try and spend the energy. A certain day this same week I was up at 2AM and I decided to reorganize my closet? Then I decided to apply for a masters degree in the UK. Just like that. Out of the blue. I even made a list of all of the documents I needed to apply and was going to contact my university in order to get them. 

In a brief moment of sanity, I knew this was not right. That was when I knew I was having another hypomanic episode and it was absolutely not anxiety and I needed to contact my psychiatrist.

I talked to my psychiatrist, she took me off the antidepressant and put me on a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic drug and we came to the conclusion this was in fact bipolar disorder. After I took the meds, I finally slept for 12h straight. 

The thing is, I have met many, many people with bipolar disorder. They go on insane shopping sprees, sleep with several different people or make embarrassing videos of themselves and post them on social media when in hypomania. 

Can there really be this wide a range of clinical manifestations of hypomania? What is it like to you?

"1750525898","SSRI for depression resulted in me having bipolar episodes","Hi, although long maybe you’ll find my story helpful in some way.

I was having a long lasting depression with severe major episodes between age 15 to 22. Appointments with psychiatrists were fruitless as my symptoms were disregarded. (Eastern bloc country, no noticeable traumatic experiences in my life that could be the cause).

When I was 15-16 I started having severe suicidal ideation (almost 24/7), self harmed myself, tried to commit suicide by my many different ways (no one knows about it).

The depression fluctuated from severe with constant suicidal ideations to mild ones over the course of years.

When 23, because of personal reasons I had fallen into the worst episode yet. I bought firearm, most effective poison available to buy freely in my country and made an appointment with psychiatrist as the last resort before fulfilling my thoughts. Then after the visit in psychiatric office, I got SSRI prescription. After a bad very bad first week I had experienced full hypomanic episode

hypomanic in my case: extremely elevated mood, increased libido, lowered self-criticism, making countless plans for the future, being fully rested no matter how long I was sleeping, taking part in many activities, joking all the time, stupid decisions.

I had a soft landing after one month and then my mind was stable almost to the end of the year.

And then again hypomanic episode, this time there was an early warning: senseless nervousness over little things. After some time I crashed into depression episode big time. It transformed into the full very rapid cycling episodes. For example in hypomanic state: 2 hours of sleep in couple of days, fully rested, working in the office full time.  Rapid cycling  stayed for a long time, after that it went into about 1 month cycles and continued for some time.

Finally in critical mental condition I ended up in psychiatric hospital, where doctors got me off SSRI and gave X drug (to get me out from the depressive episode) and drug Y (to prevent me from having hypomanic episode).

Mechanisms of these two medications worked wonderfully (in a matter of days) and now I am on observation in psychiatric hospital and feeling great. The way drug Y stopped quickly developing hypomanic episode (from drug X) was very noticeable to me.

Being there I was tested for autism and it turned out (the doctor is 99% sure) that I have high functioning autism which caused the depression when I was 15yo (not able to socialize properly with groups and generally being a little bit different caused missing many steps that teenagers and children should have gone thru). It’s a wonderful to finally feel normal.

Remember that my treatment is not a universal way and you should listen to your doctor.

I wish the best to all those who suffer from bipolar disorder.

"1750537786","Bipolar ıı","Hi everyone,

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder with hypomanic features. I’m not sure if Bipolar II is the most accurate diagnosis yet, but that’s what was written on my epicrisis report by my psychiatrist.
Looking back, I’ve felt “different” since I was a kid often paranoid, always scanning people and situations like something bad might happen. I never really thought of myself as bipolar, though. In high school, I constantly felt on edge  irritable, mildly anxious, yet also excited and full of ideas. There was a restless energy that I couldn’t shut off.Things got worse when I was prescribed amphetamines and Ritalin, which I took for about two years. After that, I feel like I’ve never truly come back to myself. It pushed me into a self-destructive, chaotic mindset that I still struggle with today. I’ve self-harmed  I cut my arm once and later tried to do it again, but wasn’t able to because my mom hid everything sharp. I never wanted to die, exactly… I just wanted the noise and confusion to stop.What confuses me most is the emotional swings. I sometimes feel this powerful grandiosity like I’m the main character in the universe, destined for greatness, like I could be legendary. That rush lasts for maybe 2–3 hours. But then it fades, and I spiral into a kind of mild depression  nothing too deep, but enough to make everything feel gray, meaningless, and slow.
I don’t consider myself brave. I honestly don’t know what happened to me, or what’s still happening. There’s a part of me that wants to fight, to build something, to get better… but there’s also a part of me that feels broken and confused about how it all got this way.

"1750512927","Been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for seven years, but that might change","I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar for seven years now, since I was 16. When I was first diagnosed, my doctors said it was bipolar 2, but that changed to bipolar 1 after a very severe episode with psychotic features. I had auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, delusions and extreme paranoia. I’m medicated and have been consistently taking my meds as prescribed for five years now! Woohoo! 

Anyways, almost every time I’ve had an episode since then, I’ve had psychotic features, mostly visual hallucinations and it’s always the same one - I see spiders. But it’s weird because it’s not like everywhere I go the room is infested with spiders, it’s just that one will pop up here or there and it won’t be real. I always make my friends or family check to see if it’s real if I’m aware I’m in an episode. 

Well right now, I’m confident I’m not in an episode. My therapist is confident I’m not in an episode. I have none of my typical manic symptoms with the exception of a weird sleep schedule (I am sleeping though!), but my hours at my job just changed so I think it’s because of that. But for the past almost 2 weeks, I have been having visual hallucinations again. Some of them are the same, I’ve seen lots of spiders, but I also started seeing words on my walls and flashes of light and other things I haven’t experienced before. 

From my understanding (as well as my therapist’s), there’s a good chance that since I’m hallucinating outside of a bipolar episode I might actually be on the schizophrenic spectrum, most likely schizoaffective disorder. We’re still trying to figure it out and I have an emergency appointment with my meds provider tomorrow to hear her thoughts, but yeah. 

I’m kind of scared. I’ve learned to accept and understand my bipolar diagnosis and I’ve never hallucinated outside of an episode before until now. This information is all so new to me, not to mention the hallucinations themselves are scary. 

So I don’t really know what to do or how to feel. I’ve come to terms with my bipolar diagnosis and the possibility of having that change is terrifying. Especially to something I know so much less about. For obvious reasons my team of doctors is refraining from changing my diagnosis for the time being because it could be really harmful to change it if they aren’t 100% certain of what’s going on but yeah. Has anyone else been through anything similar?

fast forward a few days and i have the genius and totally original thought to take a little break from my meds. why not have a little reset, feel a little \*insert adjective because who even knows\*. I was/am depressed and just thought the change would help.

ok, i'm lying! somewhere in here recently i read the phrase from someone else about 'harvesting mania.' my psychiatrist put me on a low dose of an ssri - i know it sounds crazy, but i am essentially on 3 mood stabilizers (if i actually take them) and we thought a super low dose might bump me out of my depression. me reading about the fires that ssri's can start i thought, why not try and have a little harvest, try and bring back some of that "" good "" feeling i've had before?

well i certainly don't feel good. i'm trying to chock up the loss of sleep to the zoloft side effects. last night i took all my meds because i could feel the restlessness and the REGRET starting to seep in. i didnt' tell my partner and i don't want to because i feel so ashamed and like an idiot. i skipped almost all my meds for 2-3 days (i dont remember if it was 2 or 3) and i'm just hoping that by taking them all last night i can get back on track.

I had contact with law enforcement a few times during mania and I had all positive experiences. I was afraid they were going to assume I was on drugs because of the way I was acting, but they saw right through me and could tell is was due to mental health and they were super helpful. 

After I finally came down from the episode, I have not been the same. It’s been more than 6 months from being manic and already went through the depressive crash and now I just feel nothing. 

I have always lived life in depression so it isn’t new to me, but I wouldn’t describe this as depression, but more like shame from bridges I burned, the friendships I lost, and the fact that I have no family is just weighing down on me. I don’t feel close to anyone anymore, and the friendships I thought I had, they didn’t show up for me in one of the worst times of my life. 

I’m sorry for this post being a downer. This is my first time posting anywhere and I appreciate anyone who ends up reading this.

Stimulants, a bit of structure, trying to hold things together. But something always felt off. The crashes were too extreme. My emotions, too unpredictable. Still, my doctor didn’t screen for anything else.

Then I had a full-on emotional outburst at work after a coworker twisted something I did and tried to make me look bad. I didn’t even mean to cause any issue, but I completely broke down. That was the first time my doctor considered bipolar. Turned out I wasn’t just dealing with ADHD. I had Bipolar I.

By the time I got the correct diagnosis, I had already been on ADHD meds with no mood stabilizers. When they did add the stabilizers, it hit me like a brick wall. I fell into one of the darkest, most confusing depressive episodes of my life.

I quit my job. I nearly went AWOL. Getting out of bed felt like moving through cement. I would fall asleep standing up on the bus. I literally couldn’t function. It was like my brain had shut everything down just to protect itself.

I didn’t even recognize myself anymore. Just surviving felt like a full-time job.

Now, I’m trying to rebuild. I’ve gotten some energy back. But I still wonder how much pain could’ve been avoided if bipolar had been caught before the stimulants.

She grounded him because he’s consistently late to work and he finally got written up after he was 2 HOURS late to a shift. Being upset and punishing him for a valid reason but then being nice to him later is just normal mom behavior. Mood swings don’t equal bipolar. I said “that’s not bipolar.” The whole room went silent and then the subject changed. 
When I was visiting at a different store as a trainer I overheard a conversation where the entire floor was talking about how evil and toxic some girl was because she had bipolar 2.

I don’t want to be that person that always has something wrong with them.

I have continuously done substances to excess as recently as two weeks ago and make it everyone’s problem. I think I’m done for real this time usually if I can make it 1 week without an incident I’m pretty good at sticking with it.

But it’s still the guilt and the emotional burden.

This has been my first and only manic episode. I had to quit my jobs, and I just started working again this past month and a half. I haven’t felt the same since this began.

I only feel at peace when I am sleeping, and I can easily sleep 14 hours a day. I feel a terrible level of lucidity where every day moves agonizingly slowly like I’m in an existential hellscape that lasts forever. I’m 21, so people say that my life has just begun. 

Every day I wake up and think about how terrible it is that I might have 50+ more years ahead of me. I see how incrementally anything changes. How long it took my parents to have a house and disposable income. I’m going to spend a really long time being poor.

I can only see the long road ahead of me and the machine I’m inside of. The many days of waking up and doing the same thing over and over again… waiting to go back to sleep so that I can forget for even a moment that I’m alive. 

The thoughts are intrusive and they make my days last so much longer. I never remember feeling this way about my life. I notice the sounds of my mom’s favorite birds flying in the sky and the next thought is “maybe these sorts of observations are your reason to be alive” and then “this appreciation will only last a moment, and then the feeling will sink in again”. I can’t verbalize how I’m feeling because it sounds so edgy and illogical. I think it might be depression.

He was so awesome and then when we go pregnant he turned into an extremely unsupportive person. He demonizes bipolar people and I just feel so sad now.

So I have been thinking about applying for SSI due to having Bipolar and other mental illnesses, (unsure if I am allowed to specify.) and I really don’t know if it’s worth it to try even if I were to get approved.

I have been seeking mental health treatment for 4 years now (I am 19 for reference) and I was diagnosed with bipolar by my psychiatrist on the first session/assessment. Since then I have gone through many medicine changes and I have not been able to hold a job for longer than a month, if I recall correctly I have been trying to work for 3 years- so I doubt it will improve even if we find a good combination for treatment. 

I want to know if it’s worth it to apply for SSI, my mom and partner think I should- I have applied once before (mid last year) and I got denied. I currently rely on Medicaid for insurance and I don’t know if that’s included with an SSI application. I am also worried about not being able to afford to live even with SSI.

I had no way to prevent it, and it took another manic episode based around the guilt of the first one to get me sent to a mental hospital where I finally got a diagnosis and treatment.

And all my thoughts are just telling me that when I don’t take my antipsychotic, I have more energy and am more cheery and fun. I still take my mood stabiliser every day. I know rationally that coming off my antipsychotic is wrong. The last time I went off it I ended up committing a major crime and went to prison (nobody was hurt) but got a very light sentence after the psychiatric report confirmed it all. For a time after that, I wasn’t legally allowed to stop taking my meds, otherwise I’d be recalled to prison. So I know I shouldn’t do it. I probably won’t do it. It would be selfish. But I’ve started putting two nights aside a week where I do not take them and just enjoy being up all night and not needing to sleep and being in a better mood. I don’t know what to do, I’ve been crying every day and having dark thoughts and feelings, the mental health care system here is a joke so there’s nobody really to reach out to, I’m all alone just as ever. I broke up with my boyfriend too. I hate being the slow, sluggish, fat version of me that the meds make me, but I retrospectively hate what I become when the mania and psychosis set in (I’m schizoaffective).

I want to go back to school in hopes for a job that would pay better than SSI (if I get approved), and I qualified for FASFA student loans to cover all my tuition in the fall. 

My question is, what on earth do I do??? I hate work. I hate bosses. I hate set schedules. I hate coworkers. I just want to work alone and do everything myself. I’ve fallen back on UberEats driving, which I love everything about, but it pays next to nothing. It’s grueling work for very low pay. I just can’t do it anymore. It makes me so depressed. My therapist recommends SSI. 

If I go back to school, I would hopefully find a remote job after, and hope and pray I find something that works. But I’m so scared to go through school and realize I hate it too?? I lowkey don’t even want a remote job either. The idea of a boss makes me want to run away.

I’ve been having one of the worst depressive episodes I’ve had in a long while that led me to attempt to take my life. Since then my inpatient psychiatrist has tried me on 10+ different medications. He also decided that we’ve exhausted all our other options and started me on ECT/shock therapy 3x a week a couple of weeks ago. 
So far I have had 7 shocks and I feel like I haven’t noticed any improvement. The hospital has me scheduled for 4 more sessions, totaling 11 shocks.

ruined a lot of friendships with the hurtful things I've sad

During a state of phycosis I thought everybody was out to get me so I didn't speak for days. I was certain I was being recorded

Almost got fired from work for my erratic behavior ( yelling, profanity, irritability)

Would go around destroying things in the house. 

Substance abuse (alcohol, weed,  cocaine biggest  for days at a time

The worst I've done is say things I didn't mean to my daughter and put my hands on my wife (makes me want to kill myself) They knew something was wrong so I went to see a psychologist and therapist. Eventually found a mix of medication that works for me and salvaged my relationship with my family.   Seeing me vulnerable but receptive to getting help brought us closer together than ever. On the brink of losing everything but I was able to claw my way back.  I'm still happily married with a daughter in college who likes to hang out with me. I consider myself the luckiest man ever. 

I look forward to being in this group. Thanks for listening to my TedTalk

Attempted college more times than I can remember and it always ended the same way where I just cannot do it and feel so stupid. Everything makes me so tired now, I haven’t read a book in years and honestly am perfectly content just laying down and staring at the ceiling which upsets me.

It doesn’t help that I have been taking medication on and off for about 6 years now and it definitely has affected me in the sense that everything is kinda numb and I’m not as sharp as I used to be.

"1750427800","Should I pursue a nursing degree and go back to work?","Hi everyone! I apologize in advance for the lengthy post.

So, some background: I'm 44F and I've had bipolar, anxiety, and ADHD for 25-30 years, probably longer, but only been diagnosed for 3 years. (Previously, doctors thought it was medicine-resistant unipolar depression.) Once I got my diagnosis with a new nurse practitioner and the right medication (which took a good 2 years to figure out), I felt significantly better. My biggest problem now is that I still sometimes overreact to criticism, like overthink it and have trouble forgetting it, though I bounce back within a day or so instead of being thrown into a major depressive episode as previously. 

Since I'm doing better, I'm considering going back to work but pursuing nursing. I've been mostly out of work and on SSDI since 2005. I was able to complete a bachelor's degree in English in the early 2000s with a very high GPA, really I always did well in school, so studying isn't a problem. 

My concern is the stress. I know there are less stressful nursing jobs, with fewer hours and dealing with less severe patient health, but I'm still questioning if I could do it. I don't want to get super sick again and let myself or my family down. The extra money coming in would help, but really I'm tired of being home all day and feeling like I'm not contributing or being part of the world. I think with nursing I could really help people.

(Just a few extra details: I got the English degree previously because I'd only recently gotten sick and thought I'd get over the depression fast and thought I'd pursue teaching but ultimately it wasn't for me. But with nursing, I've always really loved science and medicine, so I think I'd really like the work.) 

Anyway, I could really, really use some advice from people who suffer from bipolar. Do you think the whole thing's a bad idea? Thank you everyone for your thoughts!

"1750393827","normal people do not act like this","I am diagnosed with bipolar, I take medication for bipolar 2. Yet, I do not believe I am bipolar. I know this is normal, even people in the depths of depressive episodes will doubt they're depressed. It's normal. The way I act, however, is not normal. 

I'm in a relationship after a year or so being single. A real, genuine relationship. It hasn't been that long, and the time I was alone, I spent it all working on myself. I considered myself a confident person, I thought I was pretty and creative, and someone you'd want around. However, in the few weeks i've been in this relationship, I feel as if all my progress has been undone. He's the sweetest man, and he reassures me he likes me alot. From the get-go I felt he was out of my league. When he called me pretty I'd immediately assume he was lying. I feel worthless, and constantly tell him he could leave anytime he wants. I push and push him away, as if i'm trying to prove to myself that no one can love me. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I feel myself making up stories, stories that upset me and stories I fully believe. I feel so ugly despite feeling beautiful just weeks ago. He's not a bad man, and I feel very comfortable with him. When he plans dates, I feel myself dreading it despite really wanting to see him. I just want to cry, im so frustrated with myself. I feel like a burden in his life, and I feel like its only going to get worse. Stable people do not act like this. I'd assume so. I see people in longterm relationships and I just can't phantom it. They could tell me they love me and I'd never believe it. I love myself, I love myself unconditionally but I feel so worthless and insecure in relationships. I feel like im constantly running into walls, and it isn't any better that my therapist ghosted me. I just feel stuck. Why do I always self sabotage in relationships. Why do I feel so miserable despite begging for a relationship. Why can't I just fucking appreciate what I have.

I guess im just wondering other people feel like this too. If relationships make them tremble and how to get over this. What the fuck do I do. I don't want him to hate me. Why do I keep pushing him away.","bipolar"
"1750415703","Bipolar Love- trying to find closure","I’ve just been broken up with by my girlfriend of almost 2 years. Mystery illness flared up a few months ago and my health has been in decline since. Mood has remained more or less stable through all of this. Despite the physical pain and challenges I still value my independence even at its worst.

A few weeks ago I started focussing on my own goals, hobbies, and future career. On the medical side I’ve gone through countless tests to narrow it down and the last piece of the puzzle is an mri. The test hasn’t even happened yet but worst case I have a brain tumour or something like that. Whatever the result is I’ll finally have some structure moving forwards.

Prior to all of this my now ex girlfriend was going through her own issues with mental health, employment, discrimination, financial instability and bad reactions to medications. This was maybe a 6 month or more period where I was there for her every day. I won’t go into detail but some of these times were really hard, more than most could handle alone.

This last week I finally felt like everything was good again. We were both leaving behind a very rough start to the year. Then all of a sudden mid conversation talking about our future and joking like we always do it just happened. She said she was done. The stuff with my health was one of the main reasons and that 6 weeks ago “the feelings just went away and didn’t come back”.

I’ve been trying to wrap my head around it. She says not to blame myself but part of me wishes I’d actually done something wrong. I could at least understand if the mri said I had a brain tumour and 3 months to live but the test hasn’t even happened yet.

I’m just questioning if the relationship was more one sided than I thought it was, or if her own stress/bipolar carried the emotions, or if the stress of this year just caught up with her all at once. I don’t know. I’m past the point of asking for answers. I just want some personal closure and some idea of where to go from here.

TLDR: gf broke up with me after health issues appeared. Not trying to win her back, I’m trying to move on

"1750387733","Worplace harrasment due to bipolar","I work in a bank in an Asian country where I was required to disclose my bipolar disorder due to internal policy and in hopes of accessing reasonable accommodation, as allowed under national guidelines. While I have been managing the condition well under medical supervision and have consistently delivered good work, I’ve been facing repeated workplace harassment since this disclosure — especially from HR and senior management.

In meetings meant to discuss my KRA or role adjustments, the conversation is frequently derailed by inappropriate and mocking remarks about my medical condition. For example, a senior manager often asks,

> “What even is bipolar disorder?”
“Is there any blood test for it?”
“Why are you asking for backend roles? It’s just a normal issue — others have worse.”



They compare my condition to someone working with kidney failure, as if my request for accommodation reflects laziness rather than a legitimate need.

Most recently, I was publicly questioned in front of my colleagues by a Regional Office official. They asked for the name of my disorder, whether it could be diagnosed through a blood test, and then implied I was “hiding behind it” to avoid work. I explained politely that diagnosis is clinical, based on evaluation — not through blood tests — but that was met with disbelief and sarcasm.

Despite my efforts to remain professional, the constant emotional targeting has created a toxic and unsafe environment. I feel like I’m being punished for being transparent about a medical condition that I never asked for. I freeze whenever they start questioning it — and that inability to immediately defend myself is seen as further “proof” that I’m at fault.

Due to financial responsibilities and current economic conditions, resigning is not an option for me. I have loans and dependents. I want to keep working and contributing meaningfully. But I’m deeply exhausted from feeling that requesting reasonable accommodation equals weakness.

my mums been fighting with me a lot, and that’s just making it a lot worse.

i’m so exhausted and miserable and it just won’t go away. i wake up with zero energy and usually i can’t get out of bed for like four hours. i don’t know what to do about it, i’m trying everything i can and nothing is working. i’m eating healthy, i stopped drinking coffee and alcohol, i’ve stopped smoking, and it just feels like i’m getting more and more exhausted the more i try to get healthy.

the only time i feel like i have any energy at all is if i’m hanging out with my sister. but she’s busy a lot. i dunno why but talking to someone makes me feel normal for a little bit. but the second i’m alone again the tiredness and feeling miserable just comes back immediately.

i’ve been sleeping twelve hours, and usually i fall asleep again for another few hours because i’m just tired, and i genuinely cannot get out of bed. i don’t have the energy. i get up probably five times a day to go to the toilet, shower and maybe eat if i can make myself.

usually this only lasts for about a month of just consistently being miserable, and it goes away eventually, but it’s been like four months.

"1750366725","I ruined my life during isolation induced psychosis","I recently got very ill (some kind of inflammatory bowel disease) and I've been in and out of emergency room for 2 months. Three weeks ago I had a psychotic break after two days without water and food while in the emergency department, 6 days of liquid diet after that, 1 month of no social contact because of being confined to my apartment due to pain, being forced to drop out of school because of this, losing 12kg (26lbs) in a month and my mind shattered. 

All I did for weeks was hallucinate sounds and shadows, cry and didn't trust anyone. I thought my friends were leaving me forever and I apparently lashed out by saying some awful things. I don't remember much but I know it was BAD. Now I have no friends, I'm in constant pain and I'm not allowed pain relief meds because of the mystery disease (bad reaction). My family lives in another city so I'm completely on my own. 

Before I started community college 2023 I spent 2 years in complete isolation and I lost a part of me that I never got back. If there's a hell and individual punishments mine will be being back in my old apartment alone for eternity. Ending up isolated for a month made me feel like I was back there again and it broke me. 

I can't fix any of the relationships I destroyed and I have tried in a respectful manner but no one wants anything to do with me. My best friend said that she doesn't think I'm a bad person but that she'll need a lot of time to think and I'll honor that. I have nothing and no one but I desperately need them and I don't know what to do.

This isn't unheard of but happy endings are rare. Does anyone have any wisdom to share or managed to find the back to how things were? I know I can't force people to forgive me or talk to me and I'll always respect their choices even if it hurts but I love them and I want them in my life. I'm ""sane"" again now and next week I have an endoscopy so I'll hopefully get treatment and recover soon. 

I'll take any advice and I'm willing to do/try anything and everything (as long as it's logical, respectful to the people I hurt and not harmful). I'm so fucking lost and this is close to the worst my life has ever been, a part of secretly wishes the disease is fatal so I'll pay for what I've done. I'm thankful for any advice at all and while it's appreciated I don't need sympathy

I have never been a fan of manicures or nail extensions, but one day I woke up and decided to get one. In just a week, I spent over $200 on unnecessary things. I almost used up all my money on impulsive purchases. Every morning, I wake up feeling as if a woman is holding me down, making it impossible for me to move while I scream, though no sound comes out. Now, I feel utterly exhausted. I hear voices lot of voices. I give up having consultation with psychiatrist and having therapy, because for months that I have been doing it, it just doesn’t help me anymore.

My hair is usually long and I cut it way too short, not that I am complaining, but there is still this urge that I have to cut it again because I was left with nothing to do, like I had already done everything for myself.

And I am obsessing of wanting to start a business, like making and selling candle, but my father thinks it’s not good and I will just waste my time. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so exhausted like my mind is racing and telling me to do something.","bipolar"

I’ve been going through intense mood cycling — highs, lows, mixed states — and recently started adjusting some meds

It’s not dizziness or sleepiness — I’m fully alert and can think clearly, but I can’t move much, can barely speak, and everything slows down like I’m moving through cement. I was able to send a text right before it got really bad, but then I just… froze. My body wouldn’t respond, even though my mind was still present.

It doesn’t last forever, and I eventually come out of it — but it’s terrifying when it happens. It feels like being locked in my own skin.

Has this happened to anyone else? How did you cope with it? Did it get better as your meds stabilized?

I feel so alone in this, and like I’m losing control of my body and mind. Any stories, tips, grounding tools, or even just a “yes, I’ve been there too” would mean a lot right now.","bipolar"

"1750386616","Just need someone to listen","About 2-3 years ago I guess I had a mental breakdown. I say 2-3 years partly because I don’t really remember, and partly because it was gradual. And I say guess, because… I have a tendency to try to minimize and hide my own symptoms.   
  
I had moved halfway across the country about a year earlier, and no one seemed to really care that I was leaving and might possibly never see them again, and I think this is actually where it started, but it feels so silly to say that, being a woman in my 40s and not a child who should be so hurt by something like that.   
  
At that time I was on medication. Unfortunately I became too anxious to get my prescriptions refilled and I started going downhill fast, I started thinking if I hadn’t gotten this fixed by now then I should just accept that I couldn’t, and I was being selfish by wasting resources that could be better used by someone who was actually capable of getting better. I worried that even if I did decide to try to get help, what would that help do to me? Dementia? Affect my motor control? Make me lose my mind more than I already am? I was drowning in a whirlpool of self-hatred, self-isolation, terror, frozen and unable to do anything to save myself. I just put all my remaining effort into being as little of a burden as I could possibly be.

But I fought all that, and am now medicated, trying to improve my diet and doing whatever I can. I know I should be in therapy as well, but I just can't afford it.

That really did a number on me and on the four-year anniversary of her death, I was in a facility in terrible shape.  I was so depressed and was tired of being so depressed that I turned manic.  I hope that makes sense.  Has anyone had any similar experiences?

So I've been complying with the meds since 2016 and haven't had big issues since then but now my father/my hero has passed from leukemia 6 weeks ago.

Sometimes I go through these periods where I deeply believe something that to me feels spiritual, symbolic or even a little delusional but it feels real at the time. Like so real I emotionally react to it, cry and build narratives around it.

Then suddenly I snap out of it. I look back and I’m like “wtf was I thinking?” and feel kind of embarrassed and disconnected from the version of me who believed all that.

For example: I used to believe my vanishing twin’s spirit (confirmed medically and by my mother that she got absorbed in the womb), was still attached to me and manipulating my reality/emotions. Now I look at that and go “ok that’s actually absurd and cringe,” but in the moment? I genuinely felt it.

Sometimes I still slip into those kinds of thoughts once in a while especially during summer months again even when I know they’re irrational or symbolic at best. Like I swing between poetic spiritual religious beliefs and cold rational realistic thoughts.

I have bp2 and BPD, a really shitty combination. It makes it really hard for me to handle my finances and budget, I'm trying to get better and sort my life out but this part is what I reallyyyy struggle with.

I'm AWFUL at budgeting, so awful I've basically given up at it. I use whatever money I need and then I don't keep track of it. My savings account is pretty much my wallet, then I transfer money to the bank account I pay with. In short, I don't have an actual savings account. I recently realized how stupid this is and I'm determined to better myself.

I live alone so my expenses aren't that bad, my rent is around 406€/467$ with everything included except electricity. It's a good size apartment and I'm quite comfy, very local and kinda quiet.

My eating habits aren't great, I don't have a working appetite (chronic issue) and I don't cook, I'm scared of having food in the house cause I'm worried I'll binge eat it. My diet is reduced to protein shakes, coffee and cup noodles. I know it's not good, but I just lack interest in the whole food department.

I've looked into budgeting ""tutorials"" and tips, but I'm realizing the problem is that my brain doesn't work the same was as a neurotypical person's. I had a very bad retail therapy problem during my manic episodes, as well as impulse spending on new ""totally sustainable projects that I'll master on a whim."" I'll get super into getting my life together, ""I'm cured from my mental illness!"" Then depressive episode and my routine falls apart for a month or so.

TL;DR, I struggle with living economically, handling my income and my manic episodes often tie into impulse spending. I've improved significantly with meds, but I'm not quite there.

I guess what I’m asking is that I would like to feel emotions without constantly crying (happy or sad)… it’s just hard to control. ","bipolar"

"1750338942","Accepting I’m Unreliable","I used to think I was capable of affecting change in the world—not in any grandiose sense, but in small, tangible ways. I used to volunteer at local charities, knock on doors for causes I support, and run fundraisers for my church—small things. 

But looking back over the last decade, I can see a pattern where I volunteer and do well. The orgs I help appreciate free labor, so they ask for more. I have a hard time saying “no” so I get tapped for more and more. I might end up on their board. Then, eventually or inevitably, something happens to upset my mental health. I spiral, cut ties, and wonder WTF happened. 

This pattern has happened several times, and I can see it happening now. But I’m not sure what to do about it beyond avoiding volunteerism and positions of responsibility. Sadly, that’s where I derived most of my life satisfaction since I find my job unfulfilling. 

So what’s left? Video games and books feel like trivialities. I’ve been trying to find satisfaction in other places, but so far everything feels empty. What am I supposed to do with my life if I’m incapable of being a dependable helper? It feels like I have waaay too much free time ATM, which leads to thinking too much, which leads to thoughts of “What’s the point.”

I guess I’m just frustrated knowing that I can’t even do the one thing that used to make me feel like my life was worth something. Like what I did mattered. Now it’s gone and if I’m being honest and honoring my mental illness, it’s gone for good and I need to find something else to do. If you have any coping tools, I’d love to hear them. Because right now, I don’t feel like a person with a mental illness or disability. I feel like a disability in the shape of a person. ","bipolar"
"1750348750","I can't tell if my behavior is due to my circumstances or not.","I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 6 years ago and as I've gotten older my episodes have gotten worse. I've recently been through a lot of difficulties including a pretty bad depressive and mixed episode around 3 months ago that left my life a bunch of pieces to pick up and work around including wrecking my car, not having a way or ability to go to work both mentally and with lack of transportation and lack of support. 

I want to preface this by saying I am also diagnosed with adhd so I think these could be just impulsive decisions from adhd and not impulsivity from incoming mania.

Recently I've been able to be approved for a credit card and was able to drive my car again for the first time in 4 months and didn't think about leaving most of my things at my friends house and took my car directly from the shop that it was approved to drive at and drove it to where it was getting fixed fully in a week and a half(location H). I was also praying out loud somewhat sarcastically but also genuinely even though I don't believe in God and haven't since before I was diagnosed with bipolar before they told me my car was operable again and tattooed a small cross on myself and now it seems like God is real and was listening to me. I saw a rainbow yesterday when walking in the rain and it seemed auspicious but I don't know if thats magical thinking or just luck and circumstance.

When I drove my car to location H a week and a half early I did so knowing that I had people in the area I could stay with if needed that are somewhat found family/older friends that look out for me and my friends, but I didn't want to call so I stayed outside in the heat just smoking until I saw someone else I knew on her way home from work and she invited me to her house. I used to work with her but didn't know much about her aside from bumming me a couple cigarettes and her reputation as a crackhead but she gave me dinner, a good conversation, and some alcohol for almost 4 hours until maybe 1130. 

I felt wired and tried to sleep in my car but my phone was dying so I went to a 24hr place I could charge my phone at and texted my friends until 1 when my friends in the area texted saying they couldn't sleep and wanted to pick me up so I went there and could have slept on the floor but just read and smoked until it was around 630 and then tossed and turned until 10. I'm feeling kind of wired but I'm also a bit tired and usually I'm not tired with mania. 

I'm feeling very motivated and good with how I've started to get my life back on track and I've been speaking to my psychiatrist and therapist and have recently started a mood stabilizer. I think my impulsive actions are probably from my adhd and the circumstances but wanted to check with people who have been in potentially similar circumstances because I don't have many people in my life who have bipolar and I don't have another therapy session for 2 weeks.

Here’s my list so far:

1. Dry shampoo and throw my hair up in a hair clip to freshen up my hair on days I need to go out but haven’t had the energy to wash my hair

2. Canned beans for quick nutricious meals, would appreciate more tips on nutricious quick meals! 

3. Airfryer for quick meal preparations. I usually do freezer chicken wings.

4. Using micellar water to wash my face, I currently use Bioderma Sensibio H2O and I like it! 

5. I try to push myself to brush my teeth most days, even a few seconds is better than nothing. A little is better than not brushing at all. 

6. Own a pair of comfortable crocs! I have an easier time getting out of the house If I can quickly slip into these than bothering with sneakers. 

7. Own a google nest mini that I can easily command: ”Hey google, turn on music” for that quick dopamine hit while I’m trying to get some things done

8. If my nails aren’t done, I try to grab an appointment with my nail tech. A fresh set of nails with pretty designs on it for me to stare it gives me small hits of dopamine and elevates my mood a little bit","bipolar"
"1750350682","Lack of routine due to public transportation","This is just a rant about how difficult it is to have a consistent routine, and how it contributes to stressors that I think are causing episodes.

I have a disability that impacts my mobility. I presently do not drive because of this, so I rely on public transportation. Before it was the bus, now it’s a paratransit service.

While the paratransit service is amazing because I don’t have to worry about making transfers like I do on the bus… there’s no consistent schedule.

I work from 8-4:30. To get to work at 8am, some days I get picked up at 7am and some days I get picked up at 6am. And to leave work at 4:30pm, sometimes the pick up window is 5pm-5:30pm, others it’s 5:45pm-6:15pm.

But because it’s rush hour at that point, they’re consistently late.

I might be the first or the last to be dropped off. Yesterday I was picked up at 6:15am for work, then at 5:15pm to go home, but I didn’t get home until 7:45pm.

I try to make the most of it. Often I get to work early so I’ll go on a little walk. There’s a gym on property so if it’s a late pick up, I bring clothes and do that. I can track where the van is online so I at least am not waiting and doing nothing. I also have work for my graduate program, so I can study. I meal prep and have a chore chart to mitigate the issues that arise from being out of the house for so long.

But it sucks to have no consistency in my day-to-day. I’m applying for work from home jobs and for jobs that are closer to me. I actually have interviews coming up for jobs that would be life changing not just in having a routine again, but also they pay more so I won’t be stressed about finances on top of everything else.

I am trying to make the best of a bad situation. Even still, there’s a lot of stress and anxiety, variability between each day, and I don’t have a consistent sleep schedule at all.","bipolar"

(i should probably add that i’m not otherwise religious; i’ve been an atheist since i was about 15). so, nothing has really changed on that front. but lately a lot of the food in my house has started going bad. like, a suspicious amount. the milk is spoiled a week before its expiration date. lemons and limes are rotten. eggs go bad fast. even the jar of olives i bought was full of mold. our fridge works perfectly fine, for the record. my spouse says it’s just because of all the food restrictions that have been rolled back, but it feels like someone is out to target me directly. and i can’t help but relate it back to yellowjackets, where all their animals died and they had no more source of food. but the thing in that instant was that they killed the animals on purpose to initiate a plan. all that to say, now i’m basically paranoid that someone is tampering with my food on purpose somehow, trying to make me sick. does any of this make sense? i now have a new psychiatrist and i have not mentioned any of this to her yet (since what i told my last psych).

"1750355280","I’m so frustrated seeking diagnosis","This is my first time posting in this subreddit but i’ve been lurking for a while. I’ve been really struggling with my mental health for the past year and have had so many different doctors tell me different things and I’m struggling to find the right doctor/diagnosis, and it’s so frustrating 

In February of this year I had to spend some time in inpatient care. I was diagnosed with MDD and put on anti-depressants for the first time. I’m not sure if i’m supposed to name the medication so I won’t but it is one that is known to trigger mania/hypomania. A month after I started that medication I started experiencing what could have been mania. I had a psychiatrist but it took me a couple months to become aware of the behavior so by the time i brought it up with her it was my last appointment with her because i go to college out of state and had to return home. She put me on a medication to help anxiety at night and help me sleep and I haven’t spoken with her since because I’ve been in a different state. 

When I returned home I had an appointment with my PCP, she told me about the possibility that I am bipolar or at least experiencing hypomania due to my antidepressants. She urgently referred me to a psychiatrist at home and I finally felt like I was getting somewhere. But the psychiatrist refused to schedule me because I wouldn’t be in state year round. 

I finally got an appointment with a NP to evaluate my medication. I felt like the np didn’t listen to me and he kept talking over me.. He ended up increasing my dose of the same antidepressant and put me on a medication that was only for sleeping, even though I tried to tell him I didn’t feel like i needed help with sleep. 

I’m just so tired of telling my story and being hit with roadblocks at every turn and I feel like no one is going to listen to me. I honestly don’t have the capacity to continue advocating for myself and there’s no point in trying to get scheduled with another provider before i return to college.","bipolar"

Overall, I surprisingly handled it all very well mentally – to the point where close friends and family expressed how proud they were of how stable I have been.

Then a few months ago I moved home temporarily in between leases and that ended up triggering the worst episode I’ve had in years. I went from being the most successful I’ve ever been to rage quitting my job and pissing all my money on my vices.

This doesn’t help, but on top of that, I have had people tell me I was ‘being bipolar’ when mad at them, even when usually a neutral third party for example reading the text message, and it did in fact say what I thought it said, they also thought that was rude etc. If I’m happy, mum is worried it’s mania.

So this leaves me struggling to know whether what I feel is healthy, and should be expressed. Or a symptom, that should be managed. Whether I’m setting a healthy boundary with someone who is using me, or taking out frustration on them, so I ought to apologize.

I honestly wasnt shocked because I had my suspicions which led me to go seek out a psychiatrist and go through the diagnostic process. But I had been struggling with this for years, and previously in my life when I was a minor I had begged my parents for help and therapy which they denied...so even though I am an adult I feel scared to tell them that I got a diagnosis, and meds.

Im also a little freaked out just because of how concerned my psychiatrist was for me? like I guess thats a good thing and I know she kinda had to ask these things but right before telling me what i had she asked about any lethal weapons in the house etc. which I get, and ive been suicidal before during my mixed mood swings..but im not right now. but yeah it kinda freaked me out because im just realising like..how many of my behaviors are compulsive..but let me digress.

My psychiatrist encouraged me to tell me parents so that I could have someone that was with me most of the time (i still live with my parents) that could recognize if I need help. like a second eye. Also I want to use the insurance card I have with them lol.

The plan is to tell them after my psychiatrist sends her session notes so I can actually show them the diagnosis.","bipolar"

"1750327797","Does my bipolar make me more spiritual — or am I getting lost in it?","Hi everyone, I’m newly diagnosed with bipolar (though I suspected it for years), and I’m just beginning to understand how it affects my mind, my relationships, and especially… my spirituality.

I’ve always been spiritual since I was a child — drawn to energy, deeper meaning, nature, the stars. But when I’m in what I think are my manic or hypomanic phases, my spirituality becomes intense. Like obsessive. I crave deeper talks, I feel high on meaning, I feel like I’m more connected to the universe than most people, even a little egotistical. It gives me this rush. And then when I crash, I question everything — was that all real or just part of the episode?

Another thing: I’ve developed what might be a “favourite person” — and he’s not my boyfriend. He’s someone I became close to through my boyfriend (they went to uni together), and we connected deeply, especially through spirituality. He’s also in a relationship, and I would never cross any physical or romantic boundary. Our friendship is very pure. But I still feel guilty, maybe because society makes it seem like girls and guys can’t be close friends — especially when you’re both in relationships.

My boyfriend is loving and amazing in many ways, but he’s not spiritual. He also struggles to emotionally support me during episodes, which is hard because I’m new to managing bipolar, and he’s new to understanding it too. During my worst episode, I was clinging to life emotionally — and this other guy was the one who saw me. He was calm. He made me feel safe. My boyfriend wasn’t there emotionally, and that really hurt me. I still carry some anger toward him for that, even if I don’t want to.

So now I think this guy became my “safe person” — not romantically, but someone I deeply emotionally attached to. When we talk one-on-one, it feels different. Real. Like our souls are having a conversation. But when we’re in a group, he’s different. And I hate that I only feel this closeness when we’re alone — it feels like that’s crossing a line, even though we’re not doing anything “wrong.” But why do I crave that one-on-one time so badly? Why does it feel so emotional, when there’s no physical attraction?

I’m also waiting on an ADHD diagnosis, and I know I talk a lot — my boyfriend tries to be supportive but I think he gets overwhelmed. I just want him to feel safe and seen too. I don’t want to break anything.","bipolar"

Have you ever wondered how it would feel to have even people with the same problem not understand?  
Well, look no further than Bipolar Disorder, where every case is unique and has more range than any singer can ever have.  
With Bipolar Disorder, you can experience life in new and fun ways!  
Such as life being a roguelike, with every day being a new run of emotions, motivation, and impulse control.  
The absolute worst combinations to have almost no control over!  
Others might experience it in long, drawn-out swings.  
Others might have it feel like an amazing drug with some withdrawals.  
And don’t think all three stats stay close to one another!  
One of the scariest things is low emotions, high motivation, and no impulse control!  
So if you ever think a bipolar person can just ignore their disorder, you are sadly mistaken!  
Some lucky people don’t have it as bad as others.  
Some only experience it once in a lifetime.  
For the unfortunate lot, it's a daily struggle.  
Bipolar Disorder is a battle with yourself that can’t be won, only stalled.  
Many people lose the battle.  
Others have an easy time keeping it under control.  
It isn’t easy to seek help when medicine reacts differently per person.  
The worst part of it all is no one takes it that seriously.  
It can even be as serious as some major disabilities.  
For all those bipolar people out there, I am one of you, and I am sorry for all the suffering you cause yourself.  
I wish I could help. I wish society could help.

I couldn’t tell what was real or not, and I even felt like everyone, including my own family, was against me.

The reason I posted this in the first place was because I was connecting all the disasters I was making to me being bipolar.. but then I realized that 95% of the chaos I’ve caused was when I was under the influence of alcohol… so this is when I got curious. Even though my psychiatrist told me it’s not related and I should just not cut off my medication and be consistent I couldn’t help but think that there must be some connection because literally almost all my regrets were related to stuff I did while I was drinking, I almost reached to a conclusion that maybe it’s just me and alcohol is basically not for me but regardless I posted to see whether anyone had similar experiences.

After I posted, the post got a lot of comments where people shared their experiences and to my surprise ! almost everyone agreed that alcohol definitely affects us in much more severe ways and makes do so many things that we regret later on . After reading everyone’s experiences I’ve literally never related to anything more in my life ..just seeing the amount of people that went through so much problems and self destruction because of alcohol, made me realize that yes alcohol does affect us in much worse ways, triggers our splits .. makes us go manic in a second and then we feel the guilt and the pain and not understand how could we have possibly done such a thing 

To everyone who commented on my previous post and shared their experiences, I want to thankyou from the bottom of my heart, because you all saved my life ( truly ) ! .. because of your comments I decided that I’m quitting alcohol and never touching it again. It’s been 4 months now since the last time I drank and let me tell you guys it’s the best decision I’ve ever made ! 

My relationship with the best person improved so much, my confidence became higher, i even started seeing a different psychiatrist and my medication doses finally got reduced! I can sleep sometimes without sleeping pills, my reputation is finally getting better because unfortunately I did so many mistakes that would make anyone not consider me a good person or even a normal person to be around. I was unfortunately relying on alcohol so much that I forgot how to socialize or enjoy my time if I’m sitting with people who are consuming it .

But let me tell you, before I would mostly drink socially when others are drinking but my nights would  always end up with disasters because somehow I always ruin something.. right now I just pretend that I’m drinking or sometimes I even don’t have to I simply say I’m not feeling like drinking today, my friends and boyfriend don’t fear me anymore, I’m not a liability to anyone like how I used to be .. I can’t DESCRIBE HOW amazing I’m feeling !!! 

I won’t deny it was definitely a bit hard at first but I swear to god that the comments I read on my previous post were such a great motivation and that’s why I wanna say thankyou once again!  You guys saved me :’) 

And if anyone reading this is thinking of quitting alcohol, take this as your sign<3 I promise you, your life will change ","bipolar"
"1750334075","Recently diagnosed as bipolar I  need some help regarding work","So recently I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder specifically bipolar 2 disorder but before all that I was working with Amazon overnight and eventually I started getting panic attacks an dealing with things that were all around causing issues I began to melt down at work, but while I was at work I was on the flow team but the relevance in that is I was given a hard time because of supervisor who had it out for me an didn’t like me, he recently got put overseeing the flow team in which he then abused his power 

( I fell asleep for 10 minutes longer than my 15 minute break unintentionally which he being a hypocrite would take 1-2 hour breaks with 
a manager tried to hold that against me ) 

When I asked his specific criticism an he said my performance but that wasn’t a issue he literally has been thanking me all week for my performance, he deflected and then said 
“ you going to make this about me “ 
which I said well it’s been about you this whole time.

On top of all this HR miscommunicated their leave policy to me in which they told me I never needed documentation for taking a leave of absence an so I started to take leave of absences to try to deal with everything prior to my diagnosis and then them putting me through hell an high water over pieces of paper an my leave wasn’t even a paid leave, 
the whole situation was emotionally taxing due to amount of anxiety behind all this an them still in ways trying to hold me accountable for a policy that they didn’t even explain right which I then report to ethics company that deals with these issues I felt not taken seriously at all regarding my mental health an I want some kind of reimbursement for this or paid leave going forward as I just started psycho therapy, mind you through all of this they knew I didn’t have insurance through Amazon because of there white badge an blue badge difference with insurance coverage. 

I want to seek getting a paid leave going forward

I've been in situations were I've told my friends about my mental issues and had them chalk up all of my actions that they disagreed with to my bipolar and it lowkey killed a good couple of relationships. 

I have ""mild"" symptoms compared to other people I know with bipolar–never been hospitalized, most people I know say they never noticed anything (including my parents)–and treatment has been helping a lot I think, but I've had episodes of (what was likely) psychosis before and I don't know if I want to risk rooming with someone without giving them that context.

Manic episode started in late 2023 - ruined relationships, got arrested for DUI, smoking too much weed, went psychotic in June 2024, quit my career in a manic state in August, went psychotic again in September. 

Life fell apart completely. Had to move back home with my parents. To say I'm ashamed and embarrassed is barely scratching the surface. 

Luckily I found a new remote job a couple months ago, but it pays much less than what I was making before. I'm completely sober now, but everyday I am filled with so much regret.

This is the third time in the last 5 years I've been told that I'm bipolar by a professional. The first two times I didn't like the doctor so I simply didn't believe them. 

I went to a new psychiatrist today who actually listened to me fully and then was able to repeat what I told her verbatim to make sure she was getting it right. At the end she told me she is confident that I am bipolar. She initially said type 1 but later said my symptoms present in a way that is also consistent with type 2 so it wasn't super clear. 

I talked with my partner after the visit and immediately they said they don't think so. I should mention that my partner has previously worked in the mental health field as a diagnostician. They don't think I have mania that falls into the criteria for a bipolar diagnosis. 

I also talked to my mother, which was a mistake, but I wanted to let her know as it runs in the family (I have two aunts on her side that are bipolar.) She proceeded to tell me she also doesn't believe the diagnosis because I don't seem like my aunts where I'm ""in a psych ward screaming at people"". 

I don't understand how three separate, unaffiliated psychiatrists over the period of 5 years can all come to the same conclusion if I'm not, in fact, bipolar. 

I am so frustrated at my family, because yes, I am pretty well put together and I don't have a lot of emotional outbursts (anymore), but that doesn't negate what I've been told now THREE times. 

I have to believe it at this point, right? I have to accept it now, right? 

I don't know what to think right now. The people around me think all the doctors are wrong? 

Just as a side note: I also have ADHD, but none of them seem in disbelief of that. 

**EDIT: this just in, ALL THREE of my mom's sisters have/had bipolar (one died years ago of alcoholism). My mom is convinced it skipped her, which is laughable if I'm being honest. She just recently started going to therapy because of an incident that happened at her job. She's seen 3 therapists because she doesn't like any of them.

I don’t express my pain loudly. I was raised somewhere people don’t care about mental health. I’m diagnosed. I’m in treatment (therapist+psychiatrist). I lose my shit sometimes, but most of the time, I withdraw. I go quiet/rot in bed. And people assume I’m fine. It feels like I have to survive it and convince others it’s real. When I’m feeling stable, I stay busy fixing my life. When I’m high, I do bad things but I mostly try limit it to “positivity,” which is a strange way to describe partying, drinking, etc. Even though it rarely ends well and I'm mostly agitated and restless, I still try to do it incognito, in places I don’t plan to return to (and maybe they wouldn’t want me back anyway because I got into a fight or something...).

I’m dating, since a year, someone who, on our first date, I told I was feeling depressed and had skipped something important, but I still wanted to meet someone new and have a drink. He stable and have such a positive and loving outlook on life. But today I felt gaslit by him as if he projects how he feels onto me. I asked him about my food habits and his responses were implying I was fine. So I asked him directly if he thought I was okay. He said he definitely knows I’m not fine but that, on a day-to-day basis, he doesn’t think about it deeply.

That sometimes I drink the smoothies he makes me, and other days I take one sip only.  I feel very triggered as I was struggling so much lately with feeling so disconnected from the world and the last thing i needed was to feel like i'm just making everything up and it is just me not going to sleep, too lazy to eat, etc..

He is extremely social and I am constantly reminded of a way of being that I can't handle anymore and I can sometimes become really frustrated och start arguments about him staying out late, meeting his friends and always wanting to socialize.

Last year was my first instance of a mood episode. I have been depressed before, but I don’t believe I ever had clinical depression just being depressed about my life circumstances. Well last year everything changed. Before my final exams for college I thought some Adderall off the street because I had sold some of my prescription. What I purchased was not Adderall. I’m not sure what it was but the dealer has even told me it wasn’t Adderall. I was just having a conversation about it and I am so so so so so so so terribly distraught right now. Had I not taken that pill I bet I would’ve never gone manic the way I did. I abused regular stimulants all the time and never had any issues even going days without sleep. Last year I lost everything. I hit beyond rock bottom. If I didn’t have my parents to care for me I’d be dead, in jail, or homeless right now. This regret is literally eating me alive at this point in time. Luckily I have an appointment with my therapist in just a few minutes. Not sure how to process this though. I’m feeling pretty terribly. 

I had a life I loved. My psychiatrist believes that the mystery pill I took set something off in me that might’ve never been set off otherwise. I am so triggered right now. I have become so unwell mentally because of this issue. I finally got my life together last year for it all to be taken from me. I feel gut wrenching pain in my stomach right now.

"1750267341","Thinking of admitting myself but really scared","Short version:
I haven’t done any SH or had any attempts in a few months so I’m not a danger to myself. I’m diagnosed BP-1 ADHD and strongly suspect ASD. I am medicated and never miss a dose. 
I’m looking for information about admitting myself into the hospital because I’m terrified and confused and have no idea what I should do. 

I’ve had a horrible year, like really bad. I’m still employed and married (barely). I think I need more help than the people in my life are capable of giving me. My wife is amazing, I honestly don’t know why she’s still with me, and her mother (also an awesome person) will do anything for me but just can’t relate to what it’s like to be bipolar. I’m in good standing at work, but my job is very demanding and stressful and I have multiple employees that depend on me. I can take two weeks vacation but really don’t need to be off any longer than that and I’d rather not tell my employer why I’m taking off, just that I’m going on vacation. 

Really I’m just wondering what it’s like in the hospital and is it worthwhile to go if I’m not a danger to myself. I’m just rapid cycling like a mf and completely mentally and physically exhausted. Also, I have four children that I would be lying to and am not at all crazy about that. I could possibly talk to my 22yr and 18yr old sons about it but would rather not. Both of them know that I have some mental issues but not the extent of it. I’m completely transparent with my wife and mother-in-law so they’ll be there for me. 

This is absolutely terrifying because I’m the one that is supposed to solve problems and support everyone and be there for them and now I’m losing my shit and can’t fulfill that role. 
I feel like I’m spinning. 

My wife and I are going to see my therapist tomorrow (scheduled appt. Not emergency) to talk about childhood SA for the first time so maybe this is me crashing out over that but I don’t think so. 

I know that this is probably so poorly written that it’s been hard to follow so if you’ve made it this far and have any advice on admitting myself and what to expect once in the hospital or really just anything encouraging to say please don’t hesitate.

Original comments suggested it could be psychosis or dissociation, I have already contacted my psychiatrist and had an appointment set for next week regardless**


I think I’m experiencing a manic episode.

The past week or so I’ve been incredibly angry. Little things set me off. I’ve been incredibly rude to people when they piss me off - including customer service workers which I NEVER do - and I’ve fantasized about screaming at some coworkers who admittedly have caused me a lot of stress and emotional distress. I am noticing having more energy despite not getting enough sleep, but I followed the protocol set forth by my psychiatrist to help me sleep last night and will continue.

Yesterday I was FaceTiming a friend, though, and when I looked at my face in the little square it just looked different. I even expanded it, and the more I looked the more it morphed. It started with my jaw looking uneven, and then my right eye looking like it’s drooping, and then the right side of my face looking…weird. Like it was being viewed through a wide angle lens. But only that side.

My vision got kind of fuzzy and I felt odd. I shared with my friend what I was seeing and he told me I look normal and symmetrical. I didn’t believe him because I knew what I was seeing…

It looked normal later that day. Even later in the call.

I experienced something like that before, a few years prior to my diagnosis. But I definitely had bipolar disorder back then, just wasn’t medicated at all.

Has anyone experienced this? Is it a visual hallucination? I think I had auditory hallucinations when I got diagnosed. I told my psychiatrist about it. It’s like I would hear whispers and talking in my apartment when I was all alone.","bipolar"

So not medicated yet as I still have to do physical tests before I can start taking my pills. I also believe I may not truly have it and it might just be ADHD.

I havent slept more than 6hr each night for the past 2 days due to work commitments. However, I truly believe I'm not hypomanic or manic right now as I feel normal and not talkative (even talking less than usual).
Could it be possible my diagnosis is wrong.

The last 2 days: i do feel tired but still wired enough to not want to sleep. I had a wine bottle and was surprised to find myself drinking whilst driving (so unlike me I hate drink drivers so badly), im forgetting to eat but also don't really feel the need until I get nauseous. (I'm diabetic as well).
I'm also a teacher and have been performing alright at my job. 
I may be a bit depressed atm because my room is a state and I stayed up the other night painting (out of character but also I weirdly painted flowers but they were all black, see photo of room and drawing). IS THIS THE ROOM OF A SANE PERSON?😅😅. Also ignore the hamster cage my hamster died and have been too grief-stricken to get rid of the cage.

Was feeling super suicidal on Monday so went to the walk in mental health clinic who then told me to go to the hospital. I went, waited 5 hours before being told to go home and the crisis team will call this week. They did and now I have an appointment with their psychiatrist next week.

The public system here have decided that I have Borderline Personality Disorder instead of Bipolar, even though my diagnosis has been confirmed by 2 separate private psychiatrists - my psychologist who know me very well also agrees with the bipolar diagnosis. Because they think I have BPD, they just tell me that I need to do more DBT (event though I've been working with my therapist on DBT stuff for like 7 years, and did a 3 month stint in a private facility that was very DBT heavy). So I'm nervous that the doctor at the appointment next week will just go with the BPD thing and not listen to me at all. 

I've tried so many medications and they work for a while, before for whatever reason they stop being effective. I just don't know what to do anymore. I had a good run of a few months with no symptoms whatsoever and now I'm back in the deep end of depression again.

Sure, it came with a little crazy and bad decisions, but the euphoria was amazing.

Both events of mania with psychosis were preceded by highly stressful situations.

I tried to nap off the tiredness but failed— it looks like I’m tired too I think because my thoughts have gone so fast and hard they like hit a wall ?? And I’m spacey anyhow help and lmk thanks hospital or er is not an option I can’t do that 🙏 this all started today btw even last night I was just happy without being tired with no sleep— will caffeine or coffee work for now?

EDIT (I found the button lol): yall are saying the hospital but I just need sleep and also like the psychosis if you wanna call it that was a month ago atp really for the most part with the whole chicken and bikers and angel numbers things

EDIT 2: just emphasizing if yall got any sleep tips?

EDIT 3: silly but if you’re reading this could you upvote just cause I want as many people to give me as many sleep tips as possible ty ilysm 💕

EDIT 4: I probably won’t (really sorry Ik) cuz it’s scary but with the hospital or er or whatever- is a 17 yo able to actually do any of that? Also if a mod shows please don’t delete because I included the age maybe ask me to remove it? I need the advice tysm 🙏 oh wait duh google exists

Edit 5: yall be saying in manic but I promise I might be hypo it’s just bad because my sleep has been so so so fucking shit lol which was fine for 2 months but for some reason today it’s making me feel so weird idrg why if I was fine just like even literally this morning and dancing (and still am lol just know I’m like floaty and feet should feel real or whatever and like all that goofy stupid feeling shit)

Edit 6/Update: I actually managed to sleep a bit so I think I’m healed and fine and like cuz yeah because all those like sleep deprived feelings like floating are basically gone or just because I’m doing better and like I think I can go back to not sleeping that much and I’ll be healed again thanks for all the tips and still let me know if you have more they might be useful in case I start falling behind again and feeling gross because that would like totally suck yk ahha","bipolar"
"1750211716","Gender euphoria or hypomania?","Hello! I'm having trouble figuring out whether what I experienced last month was just gender euphoria or if it was a hypomanic episode which intensified the gender euphoria.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder twice. The first time was last year, a few months after I had a psychotic episode. Then I switched psychiatrists, and after 10 months with him, he gave me the same diagnosis again a few weeks ago. I really denied both diagnoses, thinking I'd never had a hypomanic episode, until I started researching the disorder more deeply and recalling some things from my past, especially from last month.

I'm non-binary and have thought about transitioning and stuff. But in the first week of last month, I experienced a really intense euphoria every second I thought about transitioning, about being a woman, having breasts, and so on. I was searching about transition and HRT for hours. I decided I was going to start HRT and change my name. I was really sure I was going to do this. I even made an appointment with an endocrinologist!! It was the happiest moment of my life. I can't describe the feeling. It felt better than any drug I've ever used.

I wasn't thinking about the consequences of transitioning, nor considering that for a lot of reasons I couldn't transition right now. In the second week, I felt good but thought less about transitioning, and whenever I did think about it, that feeling of extreme happiness wasn't there anymore. When I use makeup and feminine clothes, I feel good, but I can't even say it's gender euphoria. I still think about transitioning and stuff, and I feel happy about it, but nothing like that ecstasy feeling.

Also, I really believed my depression was cured, but it's back. When I was feeling good, I started some projects that now I don't have any motivation to pursue. At the end of last month, I had three days of pretty bad insomnia, and I got extremely irritated by any stimulus. My mind was racing, and I felt very agitated, anguished, and depressed.

Other things I realized: last month I spent money like I'd never done before (now I'm short on money because of that), I drank a lot compared to previous months, and I smoked a lot. I used LSD too, which was a very impulsive and stupid idea because of my previous history of psychosis.

So I'm trying to figure out if that was only gender euphoria or if the other things I've mentioned contributed to the idea that I was hypomanic. Has anyone had a similar experience being bipolar and trans?","bipolar"
"1750224138","Am considering trying to become a public speaker, would like advice.","Hi! I hope this is the right tag for this topic. I would like some advice on this though.

In 2020 I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, and then later re-diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I’ve engaged in some very destructive behavior to myself and others that I won’t overly detail here, as I don’t want to trigger anyone. I was in a toxic relationship for a long time, and have had some very low lows, with psychosis and other things included.

On top of this, in a manic episode I broke my back, and it was a long and severe recovery process. 

I had self destructive behaviors in high school, and struggled with a severe eating disorder from the time I was 12-19.

This is only part of my story, but my story ends well.

I graduated with a bachelors degree last year, and am working on a masters degree in public health. I work full time, support myself, and am paying my way through my master’s degree. Due to family support and access to healthcare and medication I have been able to manage this disorder. 

I want to get in to public speaking to hopefully give others hope that there may be another side to this disorder (I recognize even with the bipolar 1 and 2 diagnosis, bipolar still affects everyone very differently). 

My concerns with getting in to public speaking though is that I could hinder my future career goals, as this disorder still has a stigma, and I don’t want to be discriminated against in the work force. With that said, I could also see this helping my future career goals, as I think public speaking on a public health issue by sharing my personal experience, as well as the networking that comes with public speaking could be helpful. 

So my question is, could trying to become a public speaker sharing my experience with bipolar 1 help or hinder my future career goals?  ","bipolar"

"1750221191","Very confused","Hi all, 

I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 with psychosis when I was 20. I’m 27 now and have been off my meds for about a year.. mainly because I don’t have insurance anymore and other personal reasons too. I don’t feel as bad as I used to honestly so my symptoms aren’t too intense from my POV. 

For my mania, I used to have days where I wouldn’t sleep, have racing thoughts, horrible spending habits, psychosis was a big part too.. the whole shebang. For my depression, I wouldn’t get out of bed and I wouldn’t eat either so I would say it was pretty bad. 

Fast forward to now, without taking medication, I still kind of have those symptoms but they’re more manic-based maybe? The depression isn’t really there anymore, at least not as bad as it used to be. I still have psychotic symptoms and they’re mainly visual with more detail than usual (I used to just see “shadows”). Whenever these happen, I don’t think I’m in an active manic episode so I’m not sure why they’re randomly occurring. I have felt more irritable lately (which I know is a symptom of mania) but I didn’t feel that when I was recently diagnosed all those years ago. I guess I’m confused about having this diagnosis since my symptoms have changed, and it makes me wonder if that’s even possible. Not sure if bipolar disorder can “evolve” or if I was misdiagnosed…
Any advice/thoughts are appreciated! ","bipolar"

Seeing a therapist who recommended I be evaluated for autism - it has been brought up once before years ago, tho I didn't follow up. I honestly don't think I have autism, but I definitely do share some of the traits/symptoms - reading about it is actually really helping me gain some perspective into my own patterns of thought and behavior....and has helped me see why I can be a pain in the ass sometimes...and why I struggle with certain things...and also why I am very good at other things. I have similar symptom overlap w ADHD, though I do not have it either.

Like I said, I don't think I have autism or ADHD. However, my brain is fucked up. The problem is that I don't really know how to explain *how* it is fucked up. Something just isn't right. Even when my mood and overall mental health is stable, something is not right. Maybe what I am experiencing is caused by the bipolar even when I'm in between chaos episodes, I don't know.

Recently (it has been just 3 days), I started working out with 15 mins cardio workout in the morning. I have to push myself hard but doing it.

While working out I feel Ok. But after workout I feel out of energy and back to sleep.

It could very well be that currently I am out of work and depressed due to not going to work which I loved so much.

Any advice how I can make workout out better to snap out of depression? Or is it that I need to give myself more time (since it has been only 3 days) or is it that workout doesn't always help to snap out of  bipolar depression? When I am not in depression, I do work out.

I don’t want to use my bipolar disorder as an excuse or crutch but, looking back there are so many major turning points in my life that have been directly influenced by irrational bipolar behavior. 

I constantly wonder where I would be had I been born neurotypical. How much can we attribute to mental health issues and how much do you think is just being an irresponsible dumbass? I know that there is no concrete answer but still, I’m very curious about your thoughts on this. 

When you’re in an episode do you know things are wrong and know that you shouldn’t do them but just can’t help but do it anyway? Even knowing that consequences WILL be severe you HAVE to do it anyway. 

I have done this so many times (terrible things) and can’t come up with a valid reason for doing some them other than being sick at the time.

"1750198444","Managing without meds?","To try and cut a long story short: I was diagnosed right before I came home from uni for the summer, my psychiatrist said that I would be referred to the adult mental health services and that they would take over my care. I'd been having pretty much back to back episodes over the course of the semester and things were really bad. The mental health service has been in touch but they've said that I can't start medication or therapy (as recommended by the psychiatrist) until I'm back at uni, because I'm staying in a different county over the summer.

The problem is, I'm fine when I'm at home with my parents, but I know that things are very likely to go downhill when I go back to uni in August. To make matters worse, there's a lot of drama with one of my housemates and I know that a lot of my episodes have been triggered by the stress of that situation, which I'll be thrown straight back into in August. 

I know that the medication and treatment will take time to become effective, so is there anything I can do in the meantime to make sure I stay stable? At the moment I'm doing well, I'm sleeping between 7 and 9 hours a night, logging my mood every day when I wake up, making sure to eat three meals a day, and just generally trying to take good care of myself. I want to reduce the chances of another episode as much as possible, especially when I go back to uni and have to deal with the absolute shitshow of drama with my flatmate.

It’s been really difficult lately, my diagnosis is kinda recent and some people around me seem to not quite understand the severity of my situation. They keep downplaying everything I’m going through so I don’t really feel like I have someone to talk to and feel safe.

I, like many of us, have been diagnosed after a major maniac breakdown that got me into a psych ward after fucking up a lot of things in my life. I went from being 23 with an apparently perfect relationship, a great job with good pay and a lot of prestige, working out real hard every day and looking amazing, a lot of friends, going out a lot and overall a very fulfilling life to the extreme opposite. 

Now I’m at a point where I can’t really work because of my mental health, got extreme broke bc of this (in a lot of debt, owe family members a lot of money, can’t really afford my healthcare, stopped college bc I couldn’t pay the monthly fees and barely scraping by every month), never got over my ex who was really toxic so I can’t be happy with or without him, friends are all getting married or dating very seriously so I don’t have company to hang out anymore and since I don’t leave the house I can’t make new friends either. Also I don’t have cash to spend on nights out so there’s that too. I don’t work out anymore and feel so ashamed of my body bc it became weak and I can’t do the same things I used to or look how I used to look. People keep asking about me gaining so much weight and then losing it all so quickly and I don’t know what to say. I used to be beautiful, healthy, strong and now I’m a pale frail mess, looking extremely sickly, lots of vitamin deficiency and throwing up constantly.

I feel like my life is getting worse and worse over time and I’m tied up by this illness watching everything I ever hoped for slip away. Sometimes it seems like I’ll never be able to get rid of the debt since it just grows and grows each day and my income doesn’t, only way out would be education but I can’t study if I can’t afford it and with each day I feel more sunk in shit and that it gets more impossible to get out. I feel I will become more and more lonely too cause people’s lives are moving forward and they will eventually slip away if I can’t keep up, friends and romantic interests.

It just seems like my life has already gone to shit and there’s nothing I can do to fix it, like a game save file that you ruined and it’s best to just delete it and start a new one. That thought makes me wanna kill myself every fucking day because it doesn’t seem like I can turn this around.

Im a 29 yr old veteran and my Dr (psychotherapist) has told me I hit all the markers for type 1. Scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist to confirm a diagnosis. 

Im really scared. Scared about how much sense it makes but also scared I dont know who I am or how much of my life decisions have been in these manic states. My episodes last 3-5 days and after them I get depressed for months. I dont know where to begin. I dont want to tell my family, only my wife knows right now. She is super supportive but I cant begin to describe what Im feeling. 

Really just looking for any tips or support at this moment. And to not feel so alone during this process. ","bipolar"

Then I'll have days like today we're I feel amazing, Iv got ideas and plans for the future, I feel motivated to help people, I'm being more social, iv learned new skills and overall I feel pretty damn great.

"1750130380","KEEP A JOURNAL!!","I really do think keeping a journal has been one of the best choices I have ever made. Not only has it helped me keep dates of when things happen but it also gives me a huge insight into who I am and how I act during different episodes. I've always struggled to remember how I felt during a manic episode or how I thought during a depressive episode and I've struggled to figure out the dates they have started or ended but now I can just look back and find when things changed. As someone who is still in the trial and error of different meds it has been really helpful in tracking my progress too!!!

Yes it can be super difficult at times to write in a journal and I find myself having large chunks of time missing from mine but if you can force yourself to sit and write anything it is helpful. I can write pages of rants or even just one sentence entries. There is no pressure at all and no one else will ever see it but you. Looking back on it I can SEE where I acted manic. It's like I can finally understand what other people have been telling me for so long. I even write about things that I barely have a recollection of doing or acting. The blank spots in my memory are finally filled! I remember everything that I need to bring up to my doctor! The veil of confusion and memory loss can be ripped away just by JOURNALLING.

The colors burn,

so vividly, so brightly, 

I can't think, 

I can't

think

only

FEEL.

I feel

EVERYTHING.

Love without warning,

passion without relief,

incessant heat without provovation,

and the shame, the piercing guilt of it all

because

normalacy is foreign to me

as is my potential; failure stalks me.

My right mind

I've

never known;

just the alternating hollowness,

this ever-present black hole waititng to devour me,

it tempts me with the prosepct of

everlasting nothingness;

I'm enveloped in a darkness that makes death seem like freedom,

and life the sentence.

But in a flash, we're back,

climbing higher, higher,

irritatingly exuberant,

aiming to save the world,

yet not able to save myself.

I pace and I run,

my mind filled with an army of ants,

racing towards an all-consuming Queen,

attempting to store up for the inevitable winter,

because the next time it hits,

winter

may never end.","bipolar"

Where I feel out of control and crazy yet totally confident and can be unbothered at the same time.  I can be so grateful and loving over the smallest things in life, yet be wishing to die, dramatic and suicidal all at the exact same time.  It is very tiring but my question to others who experience mixed state episodes is: how long do they typically last before you notice a shift back to “normal”? Or is mixed just “normal” for you too? Do you ever adjust medications on a weekly or day to day basis? What does a mixed state look like for you? I guess my doctor would be the right person to be asking.. but if anyone would like to give their 2 cents it would be extremely appreciated. I’ve been diagnosed for almost 10 years and stable and functioning in most of that time, but I just have absolutely no one in my life to relate to which makes me feel very alone and very sad when I think about it.

"1750141580","I have found my true self","Found my perfect medication combo, im not on too little, so my brain isnt torturing itself, and im not on too much, so I dont feel empty inside.

I originally wanted to make my mania completely stop after I found out I had the disorder, so I was put on so much medication that I just felt like I didn't feel anything, but after living with that for a while, I realized that my mind is unique, and I didnt want to just completely shut it down.

After finding my combo, my mania hasn't been so bad that I feel like I want to punch a hole in the wall, but its noticeable in a good way and I love it. Obviously, it has its draw backs, im just a little more irritable and sometimes I get a little too hyper, buts its mild and I can manage it and embrace it. My mania is part of me and it makes me who I am. I find that im more productive, Im funnier, and my creative side really comes out which is helpful because I am a writer.

It feels good to know that I can be functional, happy, and fulfilled without completely shutting myself down and erasing who I am.

Mental illness really is tricky, this is my mind and its the only mind I've ever known, it is my normal.

"1750105430","Do empathetic psychiatrists exist?","I have had the most difficult time finding a good psychiatrist. When I was initially discharged from my first psych ward stay, I had to wait two weeks before meeting with a virtual psychiatrist through LifeStance. The prescribed medications at the time were not a good mix to say the least (restless legs, still couldn't sleep, still extremely paranoid) but they just let me go, with no medical provider contact but my primary care physician. When I finally did see the virtual psychiatrist the psych ward connected me to, he clearly did not review my files, was very cold, and just said ""you've been given a second chance, don't screw this up."" at the end of our first session. How reassuring for someone freshly diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Two weeks passed, and I was still extremely manic and decided to go off my meds, leading to the second episode. After being discharged from a different facility, I still wasn't provided any resources with new psychiatric providers in the area, let alone the virtual psychiatrists I spoke to during my stay. And I certainly didn't want to go back to my first provider. I've been calling practices in the area and virtual providers but everyone says they either don't treat patients in my age range, or can't help with bipolar disorder virtually, aren't accepting new patients, etc. I did book one appointment through Brightside, and answered all intake forms up front to let them know I had bipolar disorder. Provider gets on the call and says she can't treat bipolar disorder. But they made sure to take the $40 copay regardless. Also, in the short time I did speak with the psychiatrist through Brightside, I expressed that I was losing my hair and eating too much on my current prescriptions; she tells me you have to ""weigh the pros and cons"" of prescriptions. How reassuring. I've only tried two medication combinations at this point, and you're telling me to throw in the towel for one that doesn't even solve all of my mood regulation issues, and who cares about the hair loss anyways?

This is so frustrating. Any tips on how to navigate finding a good psychiatrist, where to look (have already tried psychology today with no answers back yet), would be greatly appreciated.","bipolar"

My house is so messy, there are literally ants everywhere and dirty laundry to the point I have nothing left to wear. I have absolutely no motivation at all. I feel so freaking empty, I don’t want to be around anyone (even my children which makes me feel so fucking guilty I can’t stand myself) I have basically just had my kids doing nothing but watching tv for 2 weeks straight, and it’s summer break, I should be doing all kinds of fun stuff with them! 

Im not sure if I have ever had an episode this bad. I don’t wanna end up In the hospital again. I’m a single mom, and I hate leaving my kids with my mom like that because she hates it and gets super mad at me ab it. And honestly the hospital doesn’t help anyways.

I was in denial for a while and refused any type of medication, until I had a failed attempt on my life and realized that I couldn’t keep going like this.
